{"role": "assistant", "content": "we made a video breaking down the top 10\nmost important facial features for\nattractiveness on the channel and while\nyou ranked each entry and provide\nscientific evidence to support each\ninclusion on the list it's pretty\nobvious that features like the eyes jaw\nand hair strongly contribute to a\nbeautiful face while we were creating\nthat video it got us thinking about the\nLesser known facial features that can\nactually make an important difference to\nour relative attractiveness that's why\nour team reviewed a wide range of\naesthetic Topics in the scientific\nliterature to find the more obscure\nparts of the face they can either\nenhance or detract from our Beauty but\nthey generally don't get as much\nattention as they typically should\nyou've probably noticed that we haven't\nposted in a while we've currently been\nbusy with the launch of CES 2.0 which\nwe've been working on for the past 2\nyears so if you want to get your facial\nanalysis soon you can sign up currently\nat the waiting list at curves.com have\nyou ever looked at a face and thought it\nwas attractive but outside of the more\nobvious facial features or factors like\nSymmetry and population averageness you\ncouldn't really put your finger as to\nwhy their beauty stood out so much\nperhaps they had something to do with\nsome of the top 10 overlooked facial\ntraits that we're going to be talking\nabout in this video and number 10 is a\nsubtle dip from the zyon into the cheeks\nthe zyon is the most lateral or outer\npoint of the zygomatic bone which is\npart of the cheekbone this bone plays a\nsignificant role in defining the width\nand prominence of the cheeks and the\noverall Contour of the face a subtle dip\nfrom this point into the cheek generally\ndescribes a slight inward curve or\nindentation that begins at the Zion and\nextends inwards towards the central\nparts of the face this feature can\nenhance facial aesthetic in several ways\nthe dip creates a play of Shadows and\nhighlights on the face which can\naccentuate the cheekbones making them\nappear more prominent and structured in\nwomen this makes the face appear more\nfeminine or striking and in men this\nmakes the face appear more defined or\nangular number nine is a well- defined\nfiltrum we've previously discussed the\nimportance of full lips on the channel\nbut an overlooked aspect of the mouth\nthat contributes to facial\nattractiveness is the area on or just\nabove the upper lip the filtrum the\nfiltrum is the midline groove in the\nupper lip that runs from the top of the\nlip to the not it's probably not a trait\nthat Springs first to mind but the\nimpact of the filtrum on attractiveness\nis quite substantial following an\nanalysis of the Cosmetic Surgery\nliterature Cal concluded the\ndissatisfaction with the appearance of\nthe lips stem mainly from the\ncombination of an elongated fil trim and\nthin lips so what does the ideal filtrum\nlook like then after reviewing the\nliterature we found that the ideal\ndimensions of the filtrum are width of\n10 to 11 mm or about4 of an inch with a\nlength of 12 to 15 mm which is around\nhalf an inch a longer filum can detract\nfrom your attractiveness and make you\nlook older the length is strongly\ninfluenced by aging with a progressive\nincrease in filum length over time as we\nnaturally age passing from an\napproximate optimal range of say 12 to\n15 mm to mean values of 18 to 20 mm as\nwe get older there's some evidence that\nwell performed lip injections in the\nupper lip don't just increase the lip\nsize but have the added beautifying\neffect of making a longer filtrum appear\nshorter and this is how you get a good\nresult after looking looking deeper into\nthe literature we found evidence that\nthe relative visibility of the filtrum\ncan also impact attractiveness brital\nenlisted 1,100 observers to look at\npairs of photographs of both a younger\nand older woman the second photo of each\nwoman had the filtrum digitally removed\nthe majority of observers claimed the no\nfiltrum photograph made both\nparticipants look less attractive older\nor generally made the upper lip look\nlonger the negative impact of having no\nfiltrum was more pronounced for younger\nwomen number eight is the prominence of\nyour Cupid's the filtrum isn't the only\noverlooked lip trade that influences\nfacial Beauty the prominence of the\nCupid's bow that is where the upper lip\ncomes to two distinct points towards the\ncenter of your mouth impacts your looks\nas well a well-defined Cupid's bow is\nconsidered attractive and signals youth\nas one ages there is a fling of the lips\nand this bow shape is lost according to\nSteven Hof's definition of facial Beauty\nthe ideal cupus bow is distinctive with\nan upward tilt from the commers or the\nmouth Corners to the Cupid's peak of 10\nto 20° lift are most commonly known for\nadding lip volume but they're also used\nto restore an aging Cupid's bow shape\nand recreate the impression of Youth the\nplastic surgery literature explores the\npopular stars of lip fill from the early\n2000s with most placing an emphasis on\nexaggerating the look of the Cupid's bow\nincluding What's called the Paras lip\nwhich features a well-defined Cupid's\nbow a demarcated Vermilion border and an\nincreased volume in the center of the\nlip however not all lip filler\ntechniques include a prominent Cupid's\nbow which suggests it's not an absolute\nessential tray for attractiveness this\nis clear when you look at Angelina\nJolie's lips where the fullness in her\nmouth creates a youthful appearance\nperhaps compensating for her less\nwelldefined Cupid spow the style of lip\nfiller to achieve Angelina's look the\nHollywood lip aims to create upper and\nlower lips of equal size both with\nexaggerated width and a much less\ndefined Cupid's bow number seven is your\nmedial brow position which is the inner\npart of your eyebrows we've discussed in\nour previous videos that eyebrows and\neyelashes are an essential part of what\nmakes our eyes appealing however instead\nof just focusing on eyebrow thickness\nlet's discuss one specific part of the\neyebrow that is often overlooked when it\ndoes come to attractiveness the medial\neyebrow position which is the position\nof the front part of the eyebrows\nstarting near your medial canther or the\ninner eye corner it may surprise you to\nlearn that a lower medial eyebrow angle\nis actually generally more attractive we\ncame across a study by Garcia Tel\nshowing that lower eyebrows are a\nyouthful trait younger people between 20\nto 30 had lower eyebrows especially at\nthe medial and mid brow region compared\nto the older groups of 50 to 60 it's\nkind of intuitive as we associate aging\nwith sagging all over our face but a\n2019 systemic review of the literature\nconfirmed that while the eyebrow high at\nthe lateral canthus or the end point of\nthe eyes remains constant the medial\neyebrow position at the front becomes\nhigher not lower as we age the mean\ndifference in eyebrow height with age at\nthe level of the medial canthus again\nthe inner eye Corner was measured at 1.4\nmm the preference for lower frontal\neyebrow position could be related to an\noptical illusion impacting eye size a\nJapanese study found that lower eyebrows\ncloser to the eyes make the eyes appear\nbigger while higher eyebrows make the\neyes look smaller however there is some\nvariation in eyebrow Heights and angle\npreferences as FAL showed that people\nunder 30 favor lower eyebrows and\ndisliked Arch eyebrows while older\nparticipants had the opposite preference\nthis is important if you ever consider a\nbrow lift as surgeons need to factoring\nthe ideal medial eyebrow position when\nperforming the surgery as we can see\nfrom this corrective surgery example in\nGarcia's study if done accurately brow\nRejuvenation procedures can lead to an\nunnaturally surprised appearance due to\nthe excessive elevation of the medial\neyebrow number six are dimples cheek\ndimples are a fairly rare yet highly\ncoveted facial feature dimples are the\nsmall depressions in the cheek or near\nthe mouth that appear when smiling due\nto the contraction of the mimic muscles\nparticularly the zygomaticus major while\ndimples are genetically inherited and\nquite rare surgeries like dimple plasty\ncan mimic this appearance on the cheeks\nso this begs the question of what makes\ndimples so attractive that you may get\nsurgery for it it's possible we've\nevolved to find dimples attractive\nbecause they make human communication\neasier Schmid at help posits that\nchanges in facial texture such as\ndimples could make a facial expression\nmore noticeable and communicate the\nintensity of the expression it's also\npossible that dimples are attractive on\nwomen because they enhance neoton or in\nother words they create a more youthful\nappearance a team came across a study\nthat mentioned many newborn babies have\nnon-age dimples due to their body fat\nbut these dimples often Disappear With\nage Miranda CO's dimples although she\nhas many babyfaced facial traits\ncertainly add to her cute and youthful\nappearance despite getting older the\nprevailance of dimples varies from one\npopulation to the next with just 8%\nhaving cheap dimples in a sample of over\n1,400 people in India while a Nigerian\nstudy of over 2,300 people found that\nabout 37% had chin or cheek dimples or\nboth with cheek dimples being much more\nprevailing than chin dimples in both\ncases dimples were more common in\nfemales than males for number five we're\ngoing to be talking about the nose\ndorsal cosmetic rhinoplasty was the\nfifth most commonly performed cosmetic\nprocedure in the United States in 2014\nand the second most common amongst males\nit's clear that people believe that the\nnose is important for attractiveness but\nwhile most focus on the actual size of\nthe nose or the nose tip there's one\nparticular feature that has a\ndisproportionately strong influence on\nattractiveness the dorsal or the\nhorizontal dimension of the dorsum or\nthe nose Bridge large bumps in the nose\nfrom the S profile are generally\nconsidered to be less attractive and\nappear to significantly impact\nappearance confidence with springerle\nfinding that both men and women with\nstray or concave noses were generally\nmore satisfied with their appearance\nthan those with significant nasal humps\nhow do dorsal bumps thus attract\nattractiveness a broad review of the\nrhinoplasty literature from the early\n2000s suggests that an attractive male\nnose should appear more dominant after\nrhinoplasty in other words stronger and\nstraight on in lateral view where the\nmost attractive female noses generally\ntend to be more concave with the less\nprominent dorsa therefore it appears\nthat dorsal height is more important in\nwomen than it is in men improving the\nappearance of a dorsal bump has one of\nthe biggest Returns on investment\nrelative to other rhinoplastic\nprocedures results from most atal\nrevealed the impact of dorsal High\nreduction on attractiveness amongst\nother traits looking purely at the side\nprofile images showing dorsal reductions\nwith or without manipulation of the nose\ntip were perceived as younger more\napproachable more attractive and\nhealthier number four is the glabella\nthe glabella or the brow Ridge is\nanother overlooked facial feature that\nimpacts attractiveness especially for\nmen as noted by Jones tal a prominent\nbrow Ridge is an attractive feature in\nmen associated with dominance or\nfeelings of masculinity while the\nprominence varies between ethnic groups\nthe globella area was found to be one of\nthe most sexually dimorphic features\namongst both the Native American and\nEuropean populations with women having\nmuch flatter brow ridges compared to men\na prominent brow Ridge may act as a\nsignal of high testosterone it's an\ninteresting part of the face such as for\nits impact on attractiveness and sexual\ndimorphism but also for what it reveals\nabout Evolution when we explore the\ndifference in brage prominence between\nmodern males and our ancestors it\nbecomes clear why a group of\nevolutionary anthropologists examined\nthe extremely large brow Ridge on a\nskull of a now extinct species Hydro\nGenesis and found it did not have any\nadditional mechanical function serving\ninstead as a social signal a sexually\ndimorphic display of both strength and\ndominance human brow ridges became\nflatter over time potentially coinciding\nwith fighing ability becoming less\nimportant the author's hypothesize that\nflatter brow ridges allow for more\neyebrow movement therefore making it\neasier for us to convey emotions and\nExpress empathy with other humans and\nthis explains the relative fling on the\nbrage over time we simply have to\nheadbutt humans less and less the third\nPoint are your mouth corners of the oral\ncommos it's not a beauty tray that\ntypically Springs to mind but the lines\nat the corners of your mouth called the\noral comals can impact your\nattractiveness neutral or upturn mouth\nCorners are considered more attractive\nas downturn mouth Corners increase\nperceived age caral explain that gravity\nosteoporosis Dental changes maxila\nmandibular bony reabsorption and sof\ntisue volume loss can cause the\nCommissioners to turn downwards in a\nPerpetual frown generally all of this is\nassociated with poor development or\naging downward turned mouth Corners can\nalso impact your attractiveness by\nmaking you look tired with another paper\ndiscussing facial appearance finding\nthat sleep deprived people are judged as\nhaving droopy your mouth Corners your\nmouth Corners can also influence how you\nare perceived outside of just\nattractiveness with board certified\nplastic surgeon Diane Duncan explaining\nthat downward turned oral commiss are\nassociated with a permanent expression\nof dis approval and contribute to a face\nlooking sad or grumpy overall surgical\ntechniques seem to produce a better and\nmore sustainable lifting effect on mouth\nCorners than non-surgical techniques\nhowever objective evidence is still\nquite weak injecting Botox into the Dao\nmuscles is a potentially scarless but\ntemporary alternative to a surgical lift\nthe second is the infraorbital areas\nespecially the dark circles another\noverlooked area for facial\nattractiveness is the infraorbital area\nof the eye or the skin underneath the\neye this area is where dark circles\nappear thanks to tiredness or just over\ntime with age a smoother and brighter\ninfraorbital area is considered more\nyouthful and thus more attractive L\neyelid skin is actually one of the\nthinnest on the whole body therefore\nit's not surprising that it's also one\nof the first areas where visible facial\naging occurs as facial fat volume\ndecreases with age we notice hollowing\nwhich leads to shadowing under the eyes\nespecially in the tear trough area in\nthe inferior medior orbit it's important\nto assess this area of your face in\nnatural lighting as Goldman T explained\nthat overhead lighting can worsen the\nappear of periorbital dark circles while\ndirect lining May mask the appearance\nbut the good news is it's relatively\neasy to make the infraorbital area\nappear healthier or younger and thus\nmore attractive concealer is a good\ncoverup solution in general using just\none shade lighter and the rest of your\nskin tone can add light to the area and\ncanate the dark circles hyaluronic acid\ninjection fat transfer and surgery are\nall treatment options for a more\nyouthful under eye area permanently\nhowever however there are a number of\nlowrisk skare options that make a\nsignificant difference to the region\nnral found support for retinoids top\niCal caffeine hydrone creams and\npeptides improving the appearance of\ndark circles additionally IPL radio\nfrequency and Q switch lasers can help\ntreat the area also and finally the\nfirst on the list is eye contrast the\neyes are a key feature of facial\nattractiveness ranking in the final spot\nof our 10 important facial traits list\nhowever we tend to focus on the color\nsize or shape of the eyes and Overlook\none of the most important eye features\nthe eye contrast a brighter sclero or\nthe white of your eyes and a darker\nlimbo Ring The Ring R where your iris\nmeets a scarum are signals of both Youth\nand health these traits provide contrast\nagainst the color of the iris and a link\nto ratings of higher attractiveness\nlimber rings are genetic and they fade\nwith age so there's not much you can do\nto alter their appearance beside getting\ncontacts however cosmetic eye drops are\nan easy way to reduce the redness and\nincrease the whiteness of the Scara for\na more youthful appearance enhancing the\ncontrast of the eyes against the skin\nnot just the iris also results in higher\nattractiveness ratings for women but\nreduces the attractiveness for males\nwhich contrast is a sexually dimorphic\ntrait in humans with female faces having\nhigher facial contrast on average than\nmales because of their lighter skin\ncompared to men across all ethnic groups\nthis tray is also associated with youth\nwithout contrast levels declining with\nage this explains why women choose to\nuse darker colors around the eyes as\nshown in Jones a to's research and\nmakeup enhances eye contrast against his\nskin while also increasing ratings of\nattractiveness if you're curious about\nunderstanding your facial features and\ngetting a

that applying\nsunscreen on the whole face for 52 weeks\ncan visibly reverse the signs of\nexisting sun damage to keep things\nsimple apply broadspectrum SPF 50 plus\nsunscreen every morning and reapply\nevery 2 hours when Outdoors or after\nsweating and yes this applies also to\nmen number two is to always keep perfect\ndental health and hygiene as a lost\ntooth can dramatically change the

any\nproblems with your teeth don't\nprocrastinate and solve the issue as\nsoon as possible if you are a parent and\nnotice that your child has bad teeth or\ndeformed teeth it's crucial that you\ntake them to an orthodontist number\nthree is to avoid any excessive alcohol\nconsumption you've probably seen those\nfriends of yours that began their\nUniversity years looking great and left\nUniversity 5 years later looking\ncompletely different not only can too\nmuch alcohol make you gain weight it\naccelerates biological aging and is\nactively making your organs age faster\nthan they should be suzukawa and\ncolleagues have shown that alcohol\nconsumption significantly decreases the\ncorrupt oid concentration in the skin\nwhich is what gives your face this\nhealthy looking Golden Glow alcohol also\nreduces collagen and elastin production\nleaving the skin duller wrinkled and\naged and before is to use red light\ntherapy ver Cod and colleagues gave\nvolunteers a red light mask to

probably\ncringe at your makeup and overall\naesthetic choices as a teenager or young\nadult a good example is Calvin Harris if\nyou actually look at his facial\nstructure not much has changed he

needling helps\nwith looking younger by stimulating\ncollagen and elastin production\nthickening the skin and improving skin\ntexture and appearance micro needling\ninvolves creating micro injuries in

appearance\nand reduce signs of aging by increasing\ncell turnover to keep things simple\nstart with a low concentration 0.01% to\n0.03% for beginners apply a small amount\non your inner arm for 24

leads\nto higher chances of infidelity in men\nbut not women Jim MCN at to found that\nattractive women were less likely to\ncheat than unattractive women or women\nwho felt unattractive another\npsychological aspect is the concept of\nmate value discrepancy\nthis occurs when there is a significant\ndifference in perceived attractiveness\nbetween partners the more attractive\npartner

and\nhave been linked to higher estrogen\nlevels these features can lead to more\nattention and opportunities for\ninfidelity a study by Steven W gangestad\nand Randy Thornhill found that women\nwith a lower waist to hip ratio were\nperceived as more attractive and were\nmore likely to engage in infidelity\nduring their ovulatory phase when\nfertility is highest they found that\nnormally ovulating women have been found\nto report greater sexual attraction to\nmen other than their own Partners when\nnear ovulation relative to the ludal\nphase one interpret is that women\npossess adaptations to be attracted to\nmen possessing markers of genetic\nfitness when near ovulation which\nimplies that women's interest should\ndepend on qualities of her partner in a\nsample of 54 couples Thornhill and\ncolleagues found that women whose\nPartners had high fluctuating asymmetry\nhad greater attraction to men other than\ntheir partners and less attraction to\ntheir own Partners when fertile subtle\nfacial expressions and micro Expressions\ncan also signal deceitfulness or\ninfidelity research by David Matsumoto\nfound that expressions like fleeting\nSmiles or inconsistent ey contact could\nmake observers suspect infidelity these\nmicro expressions are often involuntary\nand can reveal a person's honesty and\nFidelity cultural norms and values shape\nour perceptions of

be associated\nwith aggression and untrustworthiness\nsimilarly in women features such as high\ncheekbones and full ellipse might be\nseen as signs of beauty and desirability\nleading to more opportunities for\ninfidelity societal attitudes toward\ninfidelity vary widely in some societies\ninfidelity might be more stigmatized\nleading individuals to be more secretive\nand cautious while in others it might be\nmore openly accepted or even expected\nthese cultural attitudes can influence\nboth the behavior of individuals and the\nperceptions of observers adding another\nlayer of

only\nfactors at play personality traits\nrelationship Dynamics and situational\nfactors often provide better predictors\nof infidelity than physical features\nalone for example impulsivity lack

of Alternatives\nperceived availability of other partners\nand investment in the relationship are\ncritical factors in predicting\ninfidelity the finding suggest that\nemotional and psychological

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Video Title: Here's Why You Look Different In Pictures"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "so you probably realize that you look\ndifferent in pictures than you do in the\nmirror and I'm sure a situation like\nthis has probably happened to you before\nyou're going out on a Saturday night and\nbefore leaving you look at yourself in\nthe mirror and you find yourself looking\nvery attractive a few hours later you're\nat the party and someone takes a picture\nof you they send you the picture the\nnext day and you seemingly don't\nrecognize yourself you find yourself\nunattractive and start to wonder if\nthat's what you really look like in real\nlife so is the camera or the mirror more\naccurate which one should you trust more\nand which one accurately represents what\nyou look like in real life to understand\nwhich one is more accurate we have to\ntake a look at a few components and\ndelve into the subject from a scientific\nperspective there are six main factors\nthat impact what you look like in a\npicture compared to the mirror or in\nreality the first factor to take into\naccount is the fact that you've seen\nyour face in the mirror since your\nyoungest years your brain is so used to\nseeing the mirrored version of your face\nthat seeing an unmirrored version of\nyour face which is what you essentially\nsee in a picture might look odd or\nuncomfortable to you one test you can do\nto see how this impacts your\nself-perception is to choose a picture\nof yourself that was taken by someone\nelse in which you find yourself\nunattractive and then use an app to\nmirror that picture and see if it\nactually makes a difference you will now\nhave a mirrored picture of your face\nwhich is what you're actually used to\nseeing and when you look at yourself in\nthe mirror you'll probably notice that\nthis new version of the picture suddenly\nlooks more attractive to you why well\nbecause this is what you're familiar\nwith and this relates back to a concept\ncalled a mere exposure Theory this is\nwhat makes you realize that you are not\nunattractive in the picture but you're\nsimply not used to seeing the unmirrored\nversion of your face that might make you\nlook distorted weird or asymmetrical so\nnow you might ask yourself but does this\nmean that people see me like I see\nmyself in the mirror or do they see the\nversion I can see in the unmirrored\npicture essentially do they see the\nattractive or the unattractive version\nof myself well the answer is that they\nobviously see your unmirrored version\nbut because they are used to seeing this\nversion of you they will not have that\nsame feeling of asymmetry or Distortion\nthat you have when you're looking at the\nopposite flipped version of yourself\nthat you see in the camera and in fact\nyou can even try this interesting\nexercise that comes from a 2016 research\npaper by orange and colleagues go in\nfront of a mirror with a friend of yours\nand look at their face in the mirror and\nyou'll probably start to notice that\nyour friend does look strangely\nasymmetrical or distorted and probably\nunattractive to you that's because\nyou're used to seeing the normal version\nof them and seeing the mirrored version\nof their face look strange to you if I\ntake this picture of Zena which we can\nall agree is a beautiful woman you can\nsee that if we reverse the image the\nface does now look different but this is\nthe exact same version of the face with\nthe same level of attractiveness but\nwe're simply not used to seeing it from\nthis angle the same faced by orangan\ncolleagues compared selfie takers and\nnon- selfie takers perception of selfies\nversus photographs taken by others\nalthough oranga shared that both groups\nreported equal levels of narcissism the\nselfie takers perceived themselves as\nmore attractive and more likable in\ntheir own selfies than in other\nphotographs non selft takers viewed both\nphotographs similarly revealing notable\nbiases in self-perception by taking\ntheir moral face on this further\nconfirms the mere exposure hypothesis as\nindividuals that take a lot of selfies\nthey care mirrored pictures of their\nface start to find those mirrored\npictures more attractive as they become\nmore familiar with them and this is why\nfor example when you take a selfie on\nInstagram Instagram will give you the\nmirrored version of yourself and not the\nreal version because they know that\npeople might dislike the real mirrored\nversion the second reason why people\nmight look different in the mirror than\nin pictures is because people in general\ntend to perceive themselves as more\nattractive than what they actually are\nNicholas Epley and colleagues found in\ntheir study that this inclination to see\nyour own face is more attractive is\nlinked to how you subconsciously value\nyourself suggesting it's a reflexive and\nunconscious mental process rather than a\ndeliberate one they conducted a very\ninteresting experiment for their study\nwhere they took 27 participants 18 women\nand nine men and made them pose for a\nphotograph at the end of an unrelated\nexperiment participants had to remove\ntheir glasses and keep a neutral facial\nexpression these pictures were then\ncropped and edited to make the face more\nor less attractive and the facial images\nwere morphed in 10% increments up to 50%\nto the more attractive side and to the\nmore unattractive side of the spectrum\nparticipants returned 2 to 4 Weeks Later\nsat at a computer recalled their\nprevious photograph and were in informed\nthat modified versions of their pictures\nwould be presented there were shown a\nlineup of 11 of their edited faces and\nasked to pick out their actual image and\nas you can see from the results many\npeople thought that their real picture\nwas the 10% more attractive one on\naverage the picture that people thought\nwas the real one was substantially more\nattractive than the actual real picture\nother interesting Studies have also\nfound that this bias also extends to\npeople's close friends and families but\ndoes not extend to strangers which means\nthat a person's close friends or family\nand even romantic partners are more\nlikely to find them more attractive than\nwhat they actually are and that complete\nstrangers seem to be the only unbiased\nRaiders of someone's attractiveness the\nthird reason why you might see yourself\ndifferently in the mirror than you do in\nthe picture is because you might\nactually be used to the edited version\nof your face many research papers such\nas a 2021 study by Rebecca frog found\nthat if you tend to use apps like face\napp face tune or even filters from Tik\nTok or Instagram you might actually be\nperceiving the edited looking version of\nyour face as what you look like in other\nwords face filters in editing apps are\nactually altering how individuals see\nthemselves and their perceived\nattractiveness so when a picture of you\nis taken you might have a certain\nexpectation of what you're going to look\nlike because that picture is a raw\nunedited version of yourself and that\nmight start to look unattractive Kim be\nPerry found that this effect is also\nmore pronounced and seems to impact\nwomen more so than men ranala and\ncolleagues found that builted images can\ntake a toll on one's self-esteem making\none feel inadequate for not looking a\ncertain way in the real world and may\neven be the trigger leading to body\ndysmorphic disorder these filters and\nedits have become the norm now altering\npeople's perceptions of beauty worldwide\nthey also show that tools like Snapchat\nor face tune allow individuals to\nachieve the same level of facial\nPerfection previously reserved for\ncelebrities or particularly attractive\nexamples and we also regularly hear from\nplastic surgeons mentioning that more\nand more patients are seeking cosmetic\nsurgery to match the filtered versions\nof themselves they also found that\npeople that are more active and post\nmore on social media and especially\nthose with a higher level of engagement\non their posts may have a a higher level\nof body dissatisfaction especially if\nthey're actively trying to present a\nspecific image of themselves or are\nanalyzing and commenting on others\nphotos this can create a vicious Loop\nwhere someone is used to their filtered\nimage they might get an unedited picture\nof their face taken which will obviously\nlook less attractive and stranger to\nthem because they're used to the edited\nversion but also considering the\nmirrored effects that we spoke about\nearlier then they're going to edit this\nnew version as well reinforcing the\naltered self-perception of the face and\nessentially erasing what they really\nlook like the fourth re why you might\nlook different in pictures than in real\nlife is because of the camera itself\nmany technical factors can make you look\nmore unattractive in pictures than what\nyou do look like in real life or in the\nmirror when you see a face in real life\nyou see a 3D version of that person with\nan extremely high quality and precision\nyou can see every detail of the face\nsuch as Skin quality thickness\nirregularities eye color shadows and\nmany more important factors that do play\na role in facial perception of\nattractiveness when you take a picture\nof a face you're seeing a 2d version of\ntheir face which is incomparable to what\nyou saw in real life especially as depth\nis lost in the 2D version when it comes\nto picking up details of the face unless\nyou have an extremely high quality\ncamera the mirror will be more accurate\nat seeing what you truly look like\nrather than the picture secondly a\ncamera's focal length can drastically\nimpact facial shape and perception and\nhow attractive a face looks if you take\na look at all of these images you can\nsee that this is the same person on all\nof the pictures but the face can\ndrastically change depending on the\nfocal length generally a shorter focal\nlength like that of wide angled lenses\nfound in many iPhones today do distort\nfacial features making them appear\nlarger or stretched especially when the\nsubject is close to the camera think of\nselfies and this is something that\nmobile phones do correct in software\nbecause it's such a problem this\nDistortion makes the face appear wider\nor rounder and might make your nose\nappear way bigger than it actually is in\nreal life for example the iPhone 15's\nfocal length is 24 mm if you want to\ntake a picture make sure that the phone\nis at least one arms length away from\nyour face to make sure that your\nfeatures don't look distorted various\nother factors such as white balance can\nimpact how your skin tone might look\nlike accurate white balance ensures that\nskin tones look natural rather than too\nwarm or too cool which do affect\nattractiveness ratings as research has\nshown the type of lighting condition\nsignificantly affects perceived\nattractiveness where harsh lighting\ncoming from above the face will\nnaturally make your features look more\nwrinkle like so if you do want to take a\npicture aim for having a source of\nlighting basic the face such as sunlight\nor direct Light a fifth factor that can\nimpact why you might perceive yourself\ndifferently in pictures than what you\nlook like in real life is psychological\nState your self-perception change\ndepending on your mood and confidence\nlevels which do affect how attractive\nyou find yourself if you look at a\nspecific picture of yourself on a day\nwhen you're feeling insecure you might\nbe overly self-critical and might see\nyourself as more unattractive than what\nyou truly are and in fact if you talk to\nany photographer that works with models\non a regular basis they will tell you\nthat many attractive models find\nthemselves unattractive in pictures this\nis only a natural part of human\nself-perception Thornton and Moore 1993\ndocumented that not only does this\nhappen with female judgments but also\nmale judgments of their their own\nattractiveness are lower after exposure\nto Attractive people you can do the test\nyourself if you go look at attractive\ncelebrities on Instagram for example and\nthen look at pictures of yourself you\nmight notice how it impacts how\nattractive you see yourself and how you\nmight be more inclined to pick out your\nfeatures now the contrary though is also\ntrue if you're exposed to unattractive\nor below average looking people then\nlooking at pictures of yourself you will\nsee yourself as more attractive as a\nconfidence boost additionally your\nself-esteem and confidence will\nmassively impact how you see yourself in\npictures a 2023 study by Charles Hill\nand colleagues found that self-ratings\nof attractiveness are inflated by\nself-esteem and confidence in a self\nhalo effect positive responses from\nothers influence attractiveness\nenhancing Cycles while negative\nresponses influence attractiveness\ndeprecating Cycles with an overall\nimpact on wellbeing which means that the\nmore people you hear saying you're\nattractive or people showing you that\nthey find you attractive the more likely\nyou are to see yourself as attractive\nwhich does seem quite straightforward\nbut it's quite true now there are some\nsituations where someone might still see\nthemselves as unattractive despite many\npeople telling them otherwise zubic and\ncolleagues found in their study that\nhumans have a need for self-evaluation\nthat they satisfy by comparing\nthemselves with people who share similar\ncharacteristics as themselves and that\ncelebrities or media images form a part\nof the foundation for comparison and\nidealized self- benchmarking which means\nthat if you're a blonde girl with blue\neyes you're most likely going to compare\nyourself to someone that looks like\njezelle bunin and if you're an\nAfrican-American male in your 20s with\nshort hair you might compare yourself to\nsomebody that looks look like Keith\nPowers lastly Jones a tell found that\ntemporary mood changes itself doesn't\nexplain changes in self- perceived\nattractiveness and show that deeper\nfactors such as how someone perceives\ntheir self-worth self-esteem or even\nsocial cultural norms impact how\nattractive they do see themselves the\nsixth factor that might impact how you\nsee yourself in pictures could be that\nyou have a certain facial expression\nthat might make you look awkward when\nyou take the picture when there is\nfacial movement such as when a person is\nspeaking it does create an appearance of\ngreater or lesser facial symmetry which\nin turn affects how attractive your face\nlooks in the picture however it seems\nthat most of the changes in facial\nattractiveness in a picture versus in a\nvideo seem to be in one's own mind\nGillian rhods and colleagues conducted a\nstudy exactly on this subject exploring\nthe validity of attractiveness ratings\nmade to static images compared to\nDynamic video clips of male faces the\nresearchers conducted experiments using\na sample of 60 male faces employing both\nstatic still images and 10-second video\nclips displaying multiple viewpoints\nexpressions and movements they found\nthat attractiveness ratings from static\nimages and dynamic videos were similar\ndespite the latter containing more\ninformation about facial appearance and\nexpression lastly they found that\nattractive males as rated from both\nstatic images and videos were found to\nbe more successful in obtaining sexual\npartners particularly short-term\nPartners in simpler terms the study\nsuggests that using pictures to rate how\nattractive someone is is generally a\ngood method still even though pictures\ndon't show every detail like videos do\nthey do give us enough ecologically\nrelevant information for judging one's\nattractiveness so in the end it begs the\nquestion which one is more accurate and\nrepresents what you look like in real\nlife is it the mirror or is it the\npicture if we assume a neutral emotional\nstate it seems that a very highquality\npicture with great lighting neutral\nfacial expressions accurately represents\nwhat you look like in real life a\nhighquality unmirrored picture of your\nface is how people see you in real life\nand a highquality mirrored picture of\nyour face is what you should look at if\nyou want to see what you look like in\nreal life and with that being said if\nyou want to get your face analyzed by\nour team of doctors and dentists head\nover to the K's website for a facial\naesthetic report and as always I'll\ncatch you all in the next one"}]}

this tip is mostly for women\nthough as a study from 2022 found that\nmen naturally have yellower and redder\nscaras than women and showed\nmanipulating the Scara to look darker\nmakes faces look more masculine while\nmaking the Scara brighter makes the face\nlook more feminine higher melanin levels\nare a major advantage when it comes to\nskin aging however Provine and\ncolleagues notes that those with high\nlevels of melanin are likely to benefit\nthe most from scleral whitening due to a\nhigher prevailance of brown scleral\nspots for those with deeper skin tones\nit's difficult though to make the Scara\nlook less yellow using makeup around the\neyes to enhance facial contrast which is\nan important element of attractiveness\nfor women and tends to fade with age is\nthe easiest way to mimic the effects of\na brighter Scara and as proven in Joan\nen's research mascara eyeliner eyes\nShadow all enhance the contrast of the\nwhite Scara against the surrounding\ndarker skin let's talk about eyelashes\nnext A2 during one study found that\nwhile men do not benefit from longer\neyelashes women with longer eyelashes\nare perceived as more attractive\nhealthier and more feminine\ninterestingly older women benefited most\nfrom longer eyelashes even though lash\nlength did not actually impact judgments\nof age but then what is the ideal\neyelash length bazo and Kingston's 2023\nresearch showed that the optimal eyelash\nlength for women across different ethnic\nbackgrounds measures about 1/3 of the\neye width with slightly longer eyelashes\npreferred on African women's faces in\nall cases the shortest lashes were\nobviously the least attractive this this\narea of the eyes is quite easy to\nimprove as mascara or eyelash extensions\ncan achieve longer eyelashes quite\ninstantaneously just like brighter Scara\nand darker limble Rings it's possible\nthat longer and darker eyelashes are\nattractive because they exaggerate\nfacial contrast however cosmetic studies\nsuggest that longer and thicker\neyelashes also impact perceived eye size\na group of Japanese scientists showed\nthat eyeliner and mascara makes the eyes\nappear up to 6% larger or 133% in area\nwhile ey Shadow increases perceived eye\nsize by about 5% or 10% in area\nCosmetics are proven to enhance\nattractive so it follows that larger\neyes are more attractive on women\nhowever preferences for eye sizes and\nshape vary across cultures and are\nactually quite subjective to\nTrends a team of Korean researchers\nfound that while wi spaced eyes were\nconsistently viewed as more attractive\non women there was a large variation in\nthe ideal eye size and shape across\ncultures attractive Korean eyes measured\nlarger than the Korean population\naverage while attractive Caucasian and\nAfrican faces had slightly smaller eyes\nthan their average counterparts the\nbeauty standard for these groups instead\nrevolved around a particular eye shape\nspecifically a more upturn tilt of 7.13\nDe for Caucasians 9.98 for Africans and\nboth of these are much higher than the\npopulation averages respectively in a\nattempt to pinpoint the most attractive\neye features on women n t found that\ntypically attractive eye shapes feature\ncorrelate strongly with perceived age\nincluding large visible height of the\niris and large upward and lateral\ninclination of both the eye axis and the\nBrows although we're born with a set eye\nshape new procedures are emerging that\ncan alter the shape of the eyes you\nprobably heard of the Fox Eye brow lift\nbefore and a 2022

endoscopic Dynamic\ncanthopexy procedure with an endoscopic\ntemporal brow lift to create what they\ncall Bella eyes for armor shaped eyes\nand upturn look on younger patients\nchanging the eye temporarily is also\npossible by using eyeliner to extend the\nappearance of the eyes upwards and\noutwards leading to a less rounded\neffect by physically making the shape\nlook longer eyeshadow all

all of these\nparts of the eyelid to achieve optimal\nRejuvenation results first let's look at\nsome non-surgical options for younger\nlooking eyelids research presented at\nthe 2 Society of cosmetic chemists\nshowed that a microcurrent device are\nquite effective at lifting the upper\neyelid with results showing a 4%\nImprovement of around 28 days which in\nthis kind of literature is actually\nquite significant microcurrent devices\naren't the only facial device with\nscience back results on this part of the\neyes changal found that treatment with a\nfractional micro needling

considering eyelid rejuven a\nsurgery it's a good idea to familiarize\nyourself with the latest procedural\ndevelopments to find the right technique\nfor your eyes as this is a very quickly\nchanging field there's a new emphasis in\nthe lower eyelid bfop plasty literature\non applying a graded approach for eyelid\nassessments and providing a more\nindividualized treatment Le and\ncolleagues adjust their lower blop\nplasty technique depending on the\npatient's level of skin laxity or fat\nherniation and their level of teat\ntrough deformity developments and\ntreatments for the upper eyelid include\nMalone's blepharoplasty procedure which\ncreates a wider incision in the lateral\narea of the Brows to address excess skin\nand lateral sagging of the brow itself\nthe doctors claim that this reduces the\nneed for further brow pexi or brow\nlifting treatment so take that as you\nwill speaking of the eyebrows the\nimportance of this part of the eye\nregion is consistently underestimated\nthis from 2018 placed the eyebrows in\nthe top three most important traits for\nboth men and women's facial\nattractiveness thicker eyebrows were\nsurprisingly judged as even more\nattractive on women's faces compared to\nmen's based on these results avoid overg\ngrooming your brows to retain some of\nthat thick again though contrast is\nimportant for this area of the eye\nregion with Jones atel finding that\ndarker eyebrows are considered more\nattractive on women's faces likely\nbecause of the high contrast that these\nbrows provide being perceived as more\nyouthful this is important to keep in\nmind if you light on your hair color\nyour brows could look best a shade or\ntwo darker than your actual hair tone\ntypically we associate aging with\ngravity taking its toll but eyebrow\naging is a little more complex a 2019\nreview of the literature showed that the\nmedial eyebrow position near the front\nof the eye becomes approximately 05 in\nhigher not lower with age our brow\nposition influences our perceived age\nand can also impact our perceived eye\nsize a Japanese study found that low\neyebrows closer to the eyes make the\neyes appear bigger while higher eyebrows\nmake the eyes look smaller so for\nyounger and larger looking eyes again\navoid overgrooming the area underneath\nyour brows remember the importance of a\nlower frontal brow position if you're\nconsidering brow augmentation in the\nfuture as shown by Garcia tal an\nexaggerated brow lift can lead to an\nunnatural surprise look on the face\nwhile the medial brow Rises the lateral\nbrow Falls most notably with age and\nsome brow lifting at the ends can\nactually help the face look more younger\nand more attractive facial devices are\nalso surprisingly effective at lifting\nthe Brows no B atti showed that just one\n6-minute treatment with an at home radio\nfrequency device raised the Brows by 1.3\nCM on average on the treated side\ncompared to the untreated side at home\nmicrocurrent devices can also help treat\nsagging eyebrows where a 2022 study\nfound a 2.4% reduction in lateral brow\nsagging following treatment with a\nmicrocurrent device for 28 days so let's\ntalk about some more signs of aging\naround the eyes that can be\nreversed did you know that smiling makes\nmen and women in their 20s and 30s look\n1 to 2 years older that's according to\nresults from a 2021 study which showed\nperceived age increases while smiling\nbecause of wrinkling around the eyes the\ncrows feet thankfully there's a lot you\ncan do to reduce and prevent wrinkles in\nthis area including chemical peels\nsurgery Botox and Laser resurfacing but\nprevention can be as simple as wearing\nsunglasses a 2023 study showed thick\nTemple and wide frontal structure\nsunglasses are the most effective type\nto prevent squinting and block out\nphotoaging UV rays a good skincare\nroutine can also have a large impact on\nAging in this part of the eye where\nresearch from 2021 measured a reduction\nof wrinkle length of 3.38 mm and a\ndecrease in wrinkle area of 2.1 mm squ\nafter 4 weeks following treatment with a\nspecial peptide called Dabber now\nnaturally skincare products won't be as\neffective as Botox at reducing crowfeet\nwrinkles but it's also important to be\ncautious before overtreating this area\nDr Micha Kane notes that when this\nentire lateral orbicularis oculi muscle\nis paralyzed does result in unnatural\nPati Expressions removing these Dynamic\nlines entirely will make it look like\nyou're fake smiling even when your smile\nis genuine Dr Kane gradually reduced the\ndose of Botox from 7.5 to 10 units to\n3.75 to 5 units per side to combat this\nissue if you get BOTOX in your crow's\nfeet keep the dosage generally low and\nyou shouldn't have any significant\nproblems the last point is reducing\nunder eye wrinkling and dark circling\nwhich part of the face widens a gap\nbetween your real age and your perceived\nage the most Rosel showed that in\naddition to poor skin color uniformity\nand a lack of lip border definition your\nunder eye wrinkles and bags are actually\nthe biggest factors making you look much\nolder than you really are the skin on\nthe lower eyelids is one of the thinnest\non the entire body so it's not\nsurprising that it's also one of the\nfirst areas where visible aging occurs\nthe good news is that it's relatively\neasy to make the infraorbital area\nappear healthier younger or more\nattractive concealer is a good temporary\nsolution to add light in this region and\nalso counteract dark circles high uronic\nacid injections fat transfer blop plasty\nsurgery are all treatment options for a\nmore youthful under eye area and there\nare also a ton of skincare options for\nunder eyes that have actually been shown\nto work regarding skincare a review of\nthe literature found evidence back\nsupport for the effectiveness of\nretinoids topical caffeine hydrino\ncreams and a variety of peptide\ncompounds on the appearance of dark\ncircles so there is some hope for at\nhome remedies other at home devices like\nIPL radio frequency or Q switch lasers\nhave also been shown to work and\ngenerally do help to treat the area now\nif you want to learn more about your\nphysical characteristics or have a\nprofessional set of doctors and

"assistant", "content": "does your face have high or low visual\nweight so let's talk about this concept\nwhich has been making the rounds Lately\nfrom art Theory to human faces and how\nthis can actually apply in a practical\nsense understanding the visual weight of\nyour face is key as it impacts how you\nperceived and whether or not certain\ncosmetic Styles grooming cosmetic\nprocedures will actually enhance or\ndetract from the most Salient features\nof your face people needlessly over\ncomplicate the concept of visual weight\nwhen it's actually very simple once you\nknow what to look for you really can't\nunsee it so what is visual weight well\nfirst we'll explain the concept behind\nvisual weight in detail and then we'll\ndiscuss the three factors that influence\nthe visual weight of the face itself and\ntouch on how you can increase or\ndecrease the visual weight of certain\nareas of your face to enhance your\nattractiveness or create a particular\naesthetic or a look it's important to\nunderstand that visual weight is not\nsynonymous with fat levels or muscle\nmass instead the concept deals with how\npeople look at your face and where they\nfocus most attention visual way is a\nconcept in visual art referring to the\napparent heaviness of an object based on\nthe amount of attention that it attracts\nin simple term visual weight refers to\nhow much a particular element draws your\neye if our eyes are drawn to an object\nit is visually heavy if our eyes are not\nthen that area is visually light artists\nunderstand the importance of visual\nweight to create balance in their\nartworks or to create an effect and you\ncan apply the same principle to your own\nface when it comes to facial Aesthetics\nvisual weight refers to the overall\npresence and prominence of your Face's\nstructure and your facial features do\npeople naturally focus on particular\nareas of your face or do they look at\nthe overall Harmony of the face instead\nhow Gordon explains this concept well in\nher book look at this image of a brick\nnext to an image of a Feather we know\nthe physical weight of a brick is much\nheavier than that of a Feather but as we\ncan see here they're roughly the same\nsize and both attract our eyes attention\nto the same degree so their visual\nweight is actually equal now let's make\nthe Feather bigger our eyes are drawn to\nthe larger object which is the feather\nand so the feather has more visual\nweight now let's make the brick bigger\nthis time our eyes are drawn to the\nbrick and so it has a higher visual\nweight can you select the element that\nhas the highest visual weight from this\nseries of images it's pretty pretty\nobvious so the visual weight of an\nobject is relative to other objects\naround it and we can apply the same\nconcept to facial features try to\nremember milak Kunis's face from memory\nwhat part of her face stands out the\nmost in your mind her eyes right so her\neyes are big and stand out compared to\nher other features which are much\nsmaller and your attention is naturally\ndrawn to her eyes when you look at her\nface so she has the highest visual\nweight in this area her eyes are much\nmore memorable than her nose which just\nBlends in with the rest of her face and\nher eyes are more noticeable than her\nmouth even though she's wearing\nattention grabbing lipstick the visual\nway isn't just about the attention that\nwe place on one facial feature relative\nto another your face as a whole can have\nhigh or low visual weight or can fall\nsomewhere in between let's look at how\nwe can judge the overall visual weight\nof an image does this image have high or\nlow visual weight your eyes naturally\nlook at the image as a whole and no part\nstands out and attracts our attention\nany more than any other part so it has\nlow visual weight compare that image a\nto this image B and we don't look at\nimage b as a whole the difference in\ncircle size and the uneven spacing draw\nthe attention of our eye to specific\nparts of the image so it has a higher\nvisual weight weight than a if we add\nthis third image C to the comparison\nit's immediately clear that it has even\nhigher visual weight than b our eyes\nFocus almost exclusively on two key\nareas which is the large red circle and\nthe other large circle with colorful\npatterns apply the same principle to the\nentirety of a face and are your eyes\nnaturally drawn to key striking parts of\nthe face or do they focus on the overall\nHarmony of the face rather than any\nspecific traits which approach do we\ntypically take when we look at most\nfaces arm in and's ey tracking study\nfound that people showed no General bias\ntowards looking at the center of of the\nface instead looking first at distinct\nfacial features on the other hand\nresults from Hickman and colleagu show\nthat visual fixations on well balanced\nfaces did not focus first on any single\nfacial feature these results together\nsupport the concept of both low and high\nvisual weight faces there appears to be\na dual strategy for viewing Faces\nSometimes focusing in on a particular\nfeature and other times taking in the\nentirety of the face so let's talk about\nthe three main factors that influence\nthe visual weight of the face the first\nfactor that influences the visual weight\nis the prominence of your bone structure\nlet's look at this example from Greg\nAlbert's book the rectangle on the left\nhas solid coloring and harder edges that\ngives it an apparent density and makes\nit appear heavier relative to the\nrectangle on the right the same concept\nof harsh versus blurred edges applies to\nthe Contours of your face let's compare\nJennifer Goodwin's face to Kira nly's\nJennifer has a much rounder and softer\nface shape with little definition at the\ncheekbones or jaw while Kira has much\nmore definition that creates depth at\nher cheekbones and jawline her eyes are\nimmediately drawn to the harsh Contours\nof her bone structure and this adds\nvisual weight to her face because\nJennifer's face is much rounder with no\nharsh edges our eyes aren't drawn to her\nbone structure and we take in the\nentirety of the face at once instead of\nfocusing on a particular area like her\ncheek burs or the jawline this is low\nvisual weight is it better to have high\nor low visual weight then and which\nwould be more attractive and to be\nhonest one is not necessarily\nobjectively better than the other and no\nresearch seems to support this however a\nhigh visual weight is generally\npreferred in a western context mostly\nbecause our beauty standards favor\nsharper and more defined bone structures\nsurvey research by professor in oral and\nmaxilla Facial Surgery Morris murz\nidentified strong models square face\nshapes with developed jaw lines as the\nmost attractive in their study with the\nideal jaw angle in profile view of\naround 130 for men and 125 for women and\nthe ideal bonial to BU zygomatic with\nratios measuring at almost 1 to1 for men\nand 0.83 for women this closely\ncorresponds to the face shapes of the\nmost beautiful Western celebrities who\nhave wider jaws and cheek burs compared\nto the general population indicating\nthat at least when it comes to the first\nback to their influences visual weight\nthe Liberties tend to have higher visual\nweight than average on the other hand a\nface can have high visual weight for the\nwrong reasons for example Baker at's ey\ntracking study found that when they face\nrequired Dental aesthetic treatment the\nmouth regions surpass the eyes in terms\nof visual attention compare our Western\npreferences to East Asian beauty\nstandards where the ideal jaw angle for\nwomen is much smaller at 124° for\nChinese women according to Ma's research\na Chinese survey also found 82% of\nparticipants prefer obtuse draw angles\non women with a 50-50 preference between\nangular or obtuse draw angles for men\nthis indicates a preference for a lower\nvisual weight especially for women's\nfaces and so it's not a coincidence that\nmany East Asian celebrities also have\nlower visual weight having generally\nharmonious features with no particular\nfeature that distinctly stands out while\nwe're on the topic of bone structure\nit's also important to understand how\ntreatments like fillers or surgery can\nalter visual weight let's look at leam\nMichelle's transformation as an example\nand what do you notice about her face\nbefore she already had strong prominent\nfacial features so she had a high visual\nweight naturally if if we look at her\nafter pictures it's highly likely that\nshe had Buckle fat removal and this\nenhanced her visual weight even further\nto a point where there are too many\nparts of a face competing for your eyes\nattention B did had less visual weight\nthan Leo to begin with so similar\nchanges to a bone structure did not have\nthe same overwhelming impact on her look\nin addition to pillers or surgery makeup\ntechnique can emphasize or deemphasize\nyour visual weight where dark Contour\npowder makes Jennifer's cheekbones\nappear more prominent and this adds\nvisual weight to the face K nly's makeup\nartist for Pride and Prejudice rounded\ncheeks to reflect the beauty standards\nof the time and this reduced the visual\nweight of her face to make it appear\nmore seamless makeup techniques to\nhighlight the eyes lips or nose can also\nalter the visual weight and that brings\nus to the second factor that impacts\nvisual weight overall which is the\nprominence of the facial features the\nplacement and size of an object does\ninfluence its visual weight for example\nthe circle on the left is larger and\ncloser to the bottom of the rectangle so\nit appears heavier than the smaller\ncircle on the right the same principle\napplies to facial features let's use\nKylie Jenner's face as an example when\nshe was younger she had lower visual\nweight and you'll notice the overall\nHarmony of her face first as she doesn't\nhave any feature that draws emphasis in\nany particular direction after cosmetic\nenhancement like lip fillers and cheek\nfillers which did increase the size of\nher lips and cheeks her visual weight\nbecame much higher her eyes are drawn to\nher more prominent individual features\nrather than the overall Harmony of her\nface striking features draw attention to\nthe eye and this enhances visual weight\nlike bone structure prominence Western\nbeauty standards favor striking facial\nfeatures that draw our attention\nespecially striking eyes thick eyebrows\nand large lips if Lily Colin had thinner\nless prominent eyebrows I would the\nimpact a visual weight suddenly we can\nsee both her eye region and her face in\ngeneral have lower weight although the\nmouth and jawline and Chin can carry\nhigher visual weight on some faces\nvisually an object of a certain size\nshape or color will carry more weight\nwhen placed higher up this is a well\nobserved phenomenon in the visual art\nliterature with Rudolph noting that if\nan artist wants two halves of an artwork\nto look alike he or she must make the\nupper half shorter for balance the\napplication of this principle is all\naround us take a look at the number\nthree on your keyboard and you notice\nthat the upper part is actually smaller\nthan the bottom but it doesn't appear so\nat first glance this upper bias theory\nhas been backed up by evidence where ey\ntracking Studies by assistant professor\nWalton namp confirmed that the upper\nhalf of a visual field has inherently\ngreater visual weight than the lower\nhalf what does this mean when it comes\nto facial features though the upper half\nof our faces mainly our eyes are\nparticularly important when it comes to\nvisual weight and again this is also\nreflected in eye tracking studies three\nseparate eye tracking studies found that\nin most cases the eyes receive more\nvisual attention than any other trait\nwhat happens when you block off other\nparts of the face like the jaw or the\nnose well we can still recognize faces\nwhat about when you block off the eyes\nit's much harder to recognize a face\nwith the eyes covered suggesting we\nnaturally place a lot of visual weight\non the eyes just for facial recognition\npurposes alone it's easy to increase the\nvisual weight of the eyes and therefore\nyour entire face using makeup naturally\nlarger eyes are more prominent and\nresearch by Mor howow and colleagues\nreveal that eyeliner mascara and\neyeshadow are effective at making the\neyes appear larger in general smaller\neyes hold less visual weight the size\nisn't the only factor that influences\nthe visual weight of facial features the\nshape placement and color can also\nimpact the visual weight of an object\nfor instance male model Shao priz face\nhas very characteristically defining\nfeatures where his sharp facial controls\nadd visual weight but his eyes though\nsmall hold the most visual weight thanks\nto their complex shape and intense iris\ncolor he has fairly prominent limbo\nrings and this further enhances visual\nweight through contrast contrast is\nparticularly important for women's faces\nas Russell's 2003 study found that\nincreased luminance enhances the\nattractiveness of women's faces while\nthe opposite is a case for for men a\nfollow-up study from 2018 expanded on\nthat research and found that the\nbenefits of increased contrast for women\nare driven by the upper eye region a\nwider Scara creates a natural contrast\neffect against the skin and pesik and\ncolleagues suggest that dark limbo rings\nare attractive because they further\nenhance visual contrast in the eye area\nin addition to making the eyes look\nbigger Jones ael's research showed that\nmascara eyeliner and eyeshadow enhance\nthe contrast of the eyes against the\nskin and this also increases visual\nweight limbo rings are genetic and they\nfade with age but certain stars of\ncolored cont taxs can actually fake the\nappearance of a more prominent limbo\nring increasing contrast and thus\nincreasing visual weight let's look\nabout the spacing of your facial\nfeatures next compactness or the degree\nto which mass is concentrated around its\nCenter reduces visual weight objects\ncloser to the center appear visually\nheavier than objects at the periphery\nand as such the placement of features\nalso influences perceived visual weight\nthis is why in general smaller faces\nwith bigger features have high visual\nweight while bigger faces with smaller\nfeatures have lower visual weight even\nthough hel Berry's face is small with\nmediumsized features her wides spaced\neyes decrease the overall visual weight\nof her face while Miley Cyrus's Clos set\neyes have the opposite effect the third\nand final major factor that influences\nthe visual weight of the face is the\nvolume of the features as 3D objects our\nface naturally have volume and the\nvolume of each feature will actually\nimpact the overall visual weight what do\nyou notice about the visual weight in\nHenry Ma's painting Goods art theorist\nRudolph arnheim notes that the volume of\nthe piter and the plate makes them\nappear heavier than the surrounding\nflatter object let's apply the same\nconcept to faces and by looking at the\nvolume of the features from the side\nprofile we also see the same first note\nthat poor facial Harmony from the side\nview can draw our eye to the out of\nproportion feature and thus enhance\nvisual weight but for the wrong reasons\nin this case profile balancing fillers\nin the chin will restore Harmony and as\na result reduce visual weight this\ndoesn't mean that lower visual weight\nside profiles are necessarily better\nthough where objectively attractive side\nprofiles that is those that are dento\nfacially or orthodontically correct can\nhave higher visual weight the nose is\nthe obvious example of this where less\nflat taller noses can comp complement\nother features while still standing out\nand adding to the visual weight of the\nface the volume of other facial features\nalso matters look at this model's side\nprofile where she clearly has low visual\nweight and we take in all of the\nfeatures all at once but if you zoom out\nand include a chin it's clear that the\nprominence of the chin draws the eye and\ndoes add to the visual weight facial\nfeatures have a major impact on the side\nprofile but how does your bone structure\nfrom the side profile impact your visual\nweight as outlined in a 2016 study\nstrong gradients of color on a 3D shape\nenhanced visual weight and the same\napplies to the Shadows created by\nwell-defined bone structures while we\ngenerally attempt to enhance visual\nweight by increasing the size of our\nfeatures from the front and defining our\nbone structure from both the front and\nside view we typically favor less\nprominent facial features from the side\nshowing that Western beauty standards\ntowards visual weight are actually not\nthat clearcut and tends to vary much\nmore than say our standards for other\nthings if you'd like to learn more about\nyour own PA however perhaps from our\nteam of dentists doctors and\naestheticians head over to the coup's\nwebsite to have a report commissioned\nand have us take a look and give

most\nattractive masculine facial features\nthat are commonly seen for the most\nattractive women the first strong\nprominent eyebrows this first feature\nhas a surprisingly large impact on\nattractiveness yet the beauty ideal for\nthis tra actually does vary across time\nfour different elements of the eyebrows\ninfluence perception of both masculine\nlinity and rated attractiveness the\nfirst is the thickness the second being\nthe position the third is the shape and\nthe fourth being the color let's talk\nabout the thickness of the brow first\nwilling atel studied the impact of five\nseparate sexually dimorphic facial\nfeatures on perceptions of facial\nattractiveness and masculinity\nmasculinized thick eyebrows were\nsurprisingly the most important facial\ntrait for women's attractiveness and\nthis highlights that sometimes masculine\nfeatures like thick eyebrows are even\nmore attractive than feminine\nalternatives on women's faces even more\nsurprisingly thick thicker eyebrows were\nactually marginally more attractive on\nwomen's faces compared to men's faces so\nlet's talk about the brow position next\nwhich of these eyebrows looks more\nattractive as explained by Mel thick low\nset eyebrows are a masculine facial\nfeature and fezza atel found that those\naged 30 and under dislike the arched\neyebrows in image C and preferred\neyebrows position low and close to the\neyes like in image a participants older\nthan 50 had the exact opposite\npreference where they liked arched\neyebrows and higher positioned eyebrows\nmore this clear age difference shows\nthat ative preferences for masculine\nfeatures can shift over time and we can\ntrack this change across photographs of\nmodels in fashion magazines published\nbetween 1946 and 2011 Griffin and Kim\nfound that the browse Peak on model's\nfaces migrated more laterally from the\nlateral limbus to the lateral canthus\nover this period it's also possible that\nthe relative attractiveness of masculine\nfeatures on women's faces is impacted by\nage Billa and Kim rany similar study to\nFel this time with a more diverse sample\nand found a more lateral brow Peak was\nideal for younger faces while a more\nmedial Apex was judged to look best on\nolder faces however you shouldn't look\nat any one trait in isolation and the\neyebrows in particular show how\nmasculine features can complement\nfeminine features on the face matu AEL\nfound that digitally changing the\nposition of the Brows to appear more\nmasculine or closer to the eyes made the\neyes look bigger feminine higher\neyebrows make the eyes appear smaller\nnot really intuitive as you would think\nso one reason why masculine lower\neyebrows are more attractive is that\nthey enhance the femininity of another\ntrait the largess of the eyes the color\nof your eyebrows can also have a\nsurprising impact on the perceived\nmasculinity or the femininity of your\nface and this is another trait where\nwomen benefit from looking more\nmasculine Jones atel show that darker\nhigher contrast eyebrows are perceived\nas more masculine but are also rated as\nmore attractive on women likely because\nhigh contrast eyebrows are a youthful\ntrait seen in both sexes Victoria Secret\nmodel from the early 2010s tended to\nhave masculine brows with all four of\nthose traits being dark or even

good\non your face then you may ask shaping\nyour eyebrows in a lower set position\ncan make your eyes look bigger if that's\nyour aim overall it's best to groom your\neyebrows in harmony with your

and\nthis tend to work best for oval and\nround faces curved eyebrows with the\nlateral aspect pointing slightly more\ninferior or lower towards the center of\nthe ear suit square face shapes best\nwhereas a straighter flatter brow so\nmore masculine eyebrows suit long faces\nthe best avoiding a high arch that adds\nlength to the face unnecessarily your\ngenetics also impact the natural\nthickness position color and shape of\nthe Brows but makeup and grooming\nchoices do have a big impact on the look\ndarker eyebrow pencils and pomades can\ncreate a more masculine thick

procedures\ncan lead to an unnatural surprised look\non the face thanks to the excessive\nelevation of the medior eyebrow next\nlet's take a look at the eyes large\nround eyes are a neotenous and feminine\nfacial feature Robert toel show the eye\nregion the shape and relative size of\nthe eyes along with the superorbital\nridge is the most sexually dimorphic\npart of the face small eyes are regarded\nas a masculine trait and eye size\ninfluences our perceptions of dominance\nas found by keing in 1985 who saw that\nsmaller eyes increased perceived\ndominance more than jaw shape or even\nbrow thickness men's eyes are typically\nmore Armen shaped characterized by a\nlower palpable Fisher height meaning\nthat the eyes are quite literally\nvertically narrower and Thor nail ital\nattributes this to the development of a\nheavier brow Ridge which creates the\nappearance of narrower eyes does this\nmean small and Armon shaped eyes are\nunattractive on women's faces well a\n2023 study examined the impact of\nsexually dimorphic eye features on\nattractiveness in Caucasian paces and\nthey found ratings of facial\nattractiveness for men and women are not\nrelated to sexually dimorphic\nmeasurements of eye shape like the\nsclero size index or the width to high\nratio this suggests masculine eyes can\nbe attractive on on women's faces at\nleast in a Caucasian example so what\nabout other ethnicities then weel\ncompared the eyes of average and\nattractive people from a diverse range\nof backgrounds and they found both the\npalpable Fisher height and the eye\nFisher width were larger in attractive\nKorean faces than in average Korean\nfaces therefore large feminine eyes on\nwomen are important according to Korean\nbeauty standards the same study showed\nattractive ccasian and African faces\nactually have more masculine smaller\neyes which are relatively narrow in\npower fish height and width compared to\naverage Caucasian and African faces\nthese more masculine eye measurements\nwere also combined with a greater upturn\ntilt of the eye of around 7° for\nCaucasian eyes and 9 or to 10° for\nAfrican eyes and together they create\nthe ideal eye size and shape by that\nparticular study's Beauty standard\nperhaps these results aren't really that\nsurprising then as many attractive\ncelebrities in the Western Hemisphere\nlike mean Fox Zena Taylor Swift jaelle\nbunin and Millie Bobby Brown do have\nsmaller more masculine eyes modern eye\nenhancement techniques at least in the\nwest are not aimed at feminizing the\nEyes by making them look bigger instead\nwe're seeing a move to changing the\nshape of the eye itself in response to\ndemand from younger patients to achieve\nthe less round and more upturned ideal\nTurkish doctors recently created a\nnon-surgical eye enhancement technique\ncalled brow gliding which aims to create\narm shaped upturned eyes on young\nwomen's faces makeup techniques can also\nhave a big impact on the perceived\nmasculinity or femininity of the eyes\nand ey shadowing makes the eyes appear\nmore feminine by increasing the\nperceived eye size by 5% while dark\neyeliner in the waterline can make the\neyes appear narrower and more masculine\nrobust jaw lines are associated with\nboth masculinity and dominance typically\nit's this lower half of the face that\ncomes to mind when we think about\nmasculine patial features men's facial\nstructure is generally broader and more\ndefined compared to a woman's a 130° jaw\nangle with a jaw width similar to facial\nwidth is considered mostly ideal for men\nin contrast traditionally the oval shape\nwas considered ideal for women defined\nby a slightly wider midf compared to the\nlower face and now we're seeing a shift\nmore towards the diamond shape less\nangular and narrower jaw lines\nregardless of whichever shape We are\nfollowing they all have the trait of\nbeing less angular and narrower for\nwomen as a sexually dimorphic feminine\nfeature with smaller Jaws being linked\nto lower Androgen hormone levels while\nthese narrow jaw lines are still the\nstandard of Beauty in many East Asian\ncountries Western standards currently\nfavor a more masculine jaw line for\nwomen comparing results from studies of\nthe ideal facial angles from 1969 and\n2016 the key difference is an increased\npreference for a larger mandibular angle\nand research from 2023 showed that the\ncurrent ideal Jo angle corresponds\nhighly to high fashioned models facial\nmeasurements beauty standards favor a\nmore masculine jaw for women but how\ndoes the ideal masculine jaw line defer\nbetween men and women two 2023 studies\nused AI to quantify sexual dimorphism in\nmodern attractive celebrity faces and\nthey found somewhat similar bonial\nwidths between the Sexes where\nattractive women have relatively wide\nand masculinized jaws with attract men's\njaw Contours being just over 1 cm wider\nrelative to attractive women\nwell-defined masculinized Jaws are the\nnorm for women in Hollywood where\nseveral famous attractive celebrities\nhave robust jaws and are praised for it\nsuch as Margaret Robbie Lucy Lou and\nNatalie Emanuel strategically placed\nContour makeup can temporarily alter the\nappearance of the jaw to appear more\nmasculinized or feminized while cosmetic\nprocedures can result in a permanent\neffect widening the bonial width with\nfacial implants or with dermal fillers\nin the mandibular angle provides a Mas\ninzing effect for feminine faces\nlikewise injection of neurotoxins into M\nmuscles such as Botox or bony contouring\nof the mandibular Rus results in a\ndecrease in the bonial width or the jaw\nwidth and tapering of the lower face\nwhich does feminize the face while\ndefined jaw lines are clearly masculine\nthe sexual dimorphism of the cheekbones\nis more controversial in the literature\nsome authors actually include cheekbone\nprominence as part of a two- Factor\nindex measuring facial masculinity While\nothers consider greater cheekbone\nprominence as a sign of faal femininity\nthe real world impact of cheekbone\nprominence on perceptions of masculinity\nis clear when we zoom out and evaluate\nthe cheekbones in relation to other\nfacial features and when we compare\nangular face shapes in men and women we\nsee this more clearly brazel compared\nangular face shapes of men and women and\nfound that cheekbone width in the\nfeminine angular face is actually wider\nthan the jaw while in the masculine\nangular face shape the cheekbones can be\nequal to or narrower than the jaw High\nprominent cheekbones with a narrow\njawline results in a more feminine\nappearance and wider cheek Burns will\nappear masculine when they are balanced\nwith a similarly wide jawline a square\nface shape and this is what we look for\nwhen we commonly look at robust faced ey\nfashion models as mentioned earlier\nmodern attractive celebrities of both\nsexes have somewhat similar jaw lines\nand they even have more similar bomatic\nwidth or face wits where attractive\nwomen's cheekbone measures are just\nunder 1 cm smaller than men's we see\nthis combination of masculinizing traits\nsuch as white cheekbones paired with\nwide jawlines on celebrities like Olivia\nwild India Moore Rosario Dawson and\nAngel and jool Le of course and\nAesthetics practitioner Tracy Dennison\nexplains that a different approach to\nfiller placement is required when we're\nenhancing masculine features the\ncreation of a strong jawline using\nfillow should be balanced by the cheeks\nrunning a near to 90° angle along the\nface the feminine face has high\nangulated cheekbones while the masculine\nface has defined cheekbones running at a\nmuch lower angle often parallel to the\njawline typically this means that\nmasculinizing filler placement is lower\nand more aligned with the base of the\ntragus rather than the top of the trus\nwhich gives a feminized look in addition\nto a well- defined jawline and equally\nbroad cheekbones the amount of fat in\nthe lower region of the face does\ninfluence perceptions of masculinity and\nattractiveness and the recent Buckle fat\nremoval Trend among celebrity women\nhighlights the current preference for\nmasculinized robust faces prominent\nBuckle fat pads which are stored deep\nwithin the cheek and aren't impacted by\nweight gain do create a youthful\nfeminine and rounded face shape Buck\nofat removal creates a more defined\nmasculinized facial Contour which does\nemulate the face of someone who has a\nmore developed and matured bone\nstructure not toal notes that Buckle fat\nremoval is a key component of facial\nmasculinization surgeries while peral\nshowed that facial muscle mass has a\npositive linear impact on perceived\nfacial masculinity therefore thinner yet\ndefined lower cheeks can influence a\nperception of masculinity however as we\nexplained in a previous video on bco fat\nremoval the procedure will not enhance\nattractiveness unless the bule fat pads\nare exceptionally large and this is\nimportant to keep in mind when you ask\nANZ the features on your own face but\nyou don't give into the temptation to\nfollow Trends any of these masculine\nfacial trades could look good on someone\nbut not necessarily your own face unless\nthey're done in consideration and vice\nversa and with that being said if you'd\nlike to get an analysis of your own face\nto see if certain features would look\ngood get visualization recommendation\nfrom our team of doctors dentists and\nexperts head over to the C's website to\nhave an analysis performed of your face\nand as always I'll catch you all in the\nnext\none"}]}

standards\nin casting decisions for TV and film the\nmodeling industry evolving makeup\ntechniques and the rise and fall of\ncertain cosmetic procedures imagine that\nyou're a casting director for a moment\nwhich of these three actresses would you\nhire to star in a TV show or a film set\nin the 1960s January Jones stands out\nimmediately as the obvious choice\nlargely because she has one of the most\nimportant traits that Define classic\nbeauty high level of facial Harmony and\nbalance her balance features and\nharmonious look landed her the role of\nBetty Draper in Mad Men a TV show set in\nthe 1960s and she shares these features\nwith her 1950 Hollywood counterparts\nlike Grace Kelly Grace is named as the\nbest celebrity example of the the\nclassic body and face type in David\nkib's book metamorphosis characterized\nby high facial harmony with balanced\nevenly spaced and symmetrical features\nof course these essential elements of\nclassical Beauty are still relevant\ntoday as we've covered at length most\npeople tend to find facial averageness\nalso known as coilia quite attractive\nthis is a face with few facial quirks\nthat align closely to a configuration of\ntheir population average January Jones\nand Grace Kelly have high facial\nSymmetry and feminine features but\nthere's not one particularly striking or\nmemorable feature for either of the\nfaces when we look at other old\nHollywood icons we find the same pattern\nand this is where the classic beauty\nstandards diverge from our modern\npreferences modern developments in the\nAesthetics literature highlight the\nimportance of distinguishing or striking\nfeatures to differentiate somewhat\nbetween attractive faces from the most\nbeautiful of them all let's go back to\nthe original casting director question\nwhy wouldn't Eva Green or Olivia wild\nwork well in a 1960s role they both have\ndistinguishing unusual features that are\nmuch more suited to Modern standards\nthan a classical look the celebrity\nexamples include hel Berry and an to Joy\nwho have noticeably WID set eyes Adriana\nLima's exaggerated almost 10° tilt and\nTimothy shalom's unique chin and\nexceptionally chisel drawline modern\nBeauty has made room for the extremes at\na level we've not seen before as we've\nanalyzed it in the past where fashion\nmodel Sena has a unique combination of\nstriking feminine and masculine facial\nfeatures and notably her naso Bridge he\nalso has an ethnically ambiguous look\nwhich is heavily s after by modern\nmodeling agency not just because people\nof mixed Heritage often have desirable\nstriking features but also to reflect an\nattempt to be somewhat more inclusive\nand more relatable to a global audience\nif you ever flick through a fashion\nmagazine from the 1940s or 50s take a\nlook at the models facial features and\nyou find that they're notably different\nto those you find in magazines today\nparticularly in the side profile fulal\npractice evolution in fashion magazines\nand fan Caucasian models over time began\nto display more non-typical Caucasian\nfeatures while African-American models\ndisplayed relatively fewer Caucasian\nfeatures from the 1940s to the 1990s\nthis beauty standard exists not just in\nthe modeling world but also is clearly\nreflected in the Plastic Surgery choices\nof major celebrities like K Jenna for\nexample where become more famous after\ncosmetic treatments in line with modern\nbeauty standards and now more closely\nresembles her half Armenian half sisters\ndespite her sole Western European\nHeritage next let's talk about the lips\nclassic and modern beauty standards\ndefer quite dramatically Al in this\nparticular area and we really see the\ndeparture from classic to Modern\nstandards when we look at changing\ncasting decisions for the exact same\nroles you recognize these mouths on the\nleft we have classical Beauties like\nLata who played Wonder Woman in the' 70s\nwhile modern Beauties like gadoo who\nstart in the 2017 reimagining of Wonder\nWoman is shown on the right what\ndifference do you notice between their\nlips y's mouth is wider her lips are\nbigger and she has a higher mouth to\nnose width ratio which does fit in with\nmodern standards somewhat plump lips\nwere also desirable by classical beauty\nstandards but the preference was closer\nto a more moderate lip size and this\nstandard shifted throughout the 1900s\nwhich was reflected in evolving makeup\ntechniques fashion and Beauty expert\naliart does knowe in this video that\nMarilyn Monroe didn't overline her lips\nas much as she did in the latter half of\nthe 1950s which of these mouths do you\nthink is best then a greater emphasis on\nthe importance of bigger lips is one of\nthe most obvious departures from the\nclassical era and scientists have even\ntracked this changing Beauty standard by\ncomparing the preferences of younger\npeople with the older demographic you\nwould have probably remembered Linda as\nWonder Woman from their youth if you\nprefer larger lower lips your\npreferences are in line with younger\npeople especially those in their 20s\nwhile those in their 70s and this study\nidentifi the smallest lower lips as\nideal changes in lip ratio preference\noverall are moving to match the L held\nideal 1:1 ratio for women of color and\nas noted by contel traditionally a 2 to3\nupper to lower ratio was desirable for\nCaucasian women while now increasingly a\nratio of 1 to one is seemed to be sought\nafter in all races The Beauty standard\nfor the relative size of the upper and\nlower lips has changed and also is how\nthe lips compare to other features human\ninvestigated age differences in\npreferred lip to nose width ratios and\nfound that those over 50 prefer a\nnarrower lip width relative to the nose\ncompared to younger people favoring a\nlip width of 150% of the nose width her\nincreased lip side actually made the\nmost notable difference du Kylie genous\ntransformation and as reflected in the\npopularity of lip fillers one of the\nmost defining shifts in modern beauty\nstandards is the availability and\nacceptability of cosmetic enhancements\nit's now easier than ever to actually\nmatch the beauty standard if you weren't\nborn with the supposed ideal proportion\nof the time the mouth is also probably\nthe most error defining facial feature\nof all we can see the through casting\ndecisions for the few Hollywood\nactresses whose lips deviate\ndramatically from the modern Beauty\nstandard so with this in mind let's play\nthat casting decision game again and\nwhich actress would actually work the\nbest in a 1960s role is not as clear now\nthe math region alone has a big impact\non the decision here Alexis BL is the\nmost obvious choice where Chloe Cherry's\nlips are clearly too modern while\nNatalie dma's lips are small with an\nasymmetrical mouth and the thinness\nbreaks the Hollywood mold she doesn't\nhave a smartphone face as some may put\nit her mouth and lip to no ratio are not\nexactly classical either being more\nreminiscent of portraits of Tudor era\nQueens which explains why she was cast\nas anolin and the tutors and played a\nstarring role in Game of Thrones we zoom\nout from the lips though for a moment\nand focus on the face as a whole\nwhat differences do you actually notice\nbetween gal and Linda's face shapes G's\ndrawline is much more defined and she\nhas a more traditionally masculine\nSquare Face compared to Linda's feminine\noval or diamond shaped face while both\nwomen benefit from high cheekbones\nLinda's cheeks are noticeably Fuller\nthan Ya's her modern preferences have\nevolved to appreciate sharper features\non women which is a departure from the\nclassical beauty standards that focused\nheavily on femininity with little room\nfor androgyny as shown through RH and\ncolleagues research both men and women\nrate hyper mized female faces as more\nattractive however some androgyny in the\nright places can enhance a woman's\nBeauty with the most attractive modern\nfemale faces being characterized by\nfeminine neotenous features in the\nmiddle coupled with mature features or\nonogen features along the outer\nperimeters think of few large eyes and\nsharp cheekbones on the outside hyper\nfeminine faces and those with a\nparticular mix of feminine and masculine\npeaches are both considered attractive\nthe latter is preferred by modern\nstandards with a new 2023 study\nrevealing a western preference for\nsharper facial features can you guess\nwho these jaw lines belong to first off\nwell this model's lower jaw was rated as\nmost attractive with an angle of 142 in\nthe frontal view and the second model\nhad the ideal jaw in profile view of 125\nand finally this model had the ideal jaw\npositioning vertically positioned at the\nlevel of the storian or the upper lip so\nthe most attractive celebrities or\nmodels who closely fit our beauty\nstandards have faces with wider Jaws\ncompared to the average person which\nemphasizes the importance of\nwell-defined bone structures for\nphysical attractiveness in this modern\nera context but that study only looked\nat Caucasian faces how does our modern\nconception of beauty differ from\nclassical standards for those from other\nbackgrounds again wide faces with sharp\nfeatures are the modern ideal according\nto a 2023 study which analyzed the most\nbeautiful celebrities of African\nheritages and found the ratio of facial\nheight to bonial width for celebrities\nwas lower than the measured average in\nThe Wider African-American population\n1.61 and 1.64 for celebrity men and\nwomen respectively compared to 1.85 and\n1.86 in the average population although\nthere's no documented analysis of the\nideal facial proportions back in the era\nof old Hollywood we can also make\njudgments based on the appearance of the\nmost prominent celebrities and we can\nalso analyze shifting makeup trends\nprofessional makeup artist Lisa Eldridge\nnotes that while Marilyn Monroe's makeup\nartist applied Contour along her jawline\nits purpose was to make the bottom half\nof her face look more feminine or small\nsmaller and yess closer to the\nheart-shaped ideal and to add subtle\ndimensions on camera compare Lisa\neldridge's replica of Marilyn's exact\nmakeup look to the modern day extreme\ncontour and the highlighting techniques\nthat we use to sculpt out a chisel\njawline or sharper cheekbones as shown\nhere on Kim Kardashian's face by her\nmakeup artist Mario DD vanov a trend\ntowards a preference for sharper\nfeatures is also found on the upper half\nof the face let's compare Linda and\ngal's eye regions and we see that\nLinda's eyes are rounder with thinner\nbrows while gal has a much thicker\neyebrow and striking more upturned arm\nanded eyes so can you match these\neyebrows in the correct eror then it's\nobvious that all of these examples\nexcept the 80s brow They Don't Really\nmatch with modern beauty standards\nespecially the 20s and 1930s eyebrows\nwhere gretag gaba's exceptionally thin\nvery high brows would be considered a\ndramatic fashion statement today but\nthis was actually more of the norm in\nthe 30s all the way throughout to the '\n50s as makeup artist Lisa Eldridge notes\nin her book face paint the story of\nmakeup in in 1950 and entire 9 years\nafter Greta made her last movie she was\nvoted the most beautiful woman in the\nworld by the Guinness Book of World\nRecords comparing eyebrow preferences of\nthe young and old confirms the shift in\nstandards over time where fessa atal in\n2007 showed that people under 30 favor\nlower eyebrows and dislike arched\neyebrows while older participants had\nthe exact opposite preference the shift\nfrom classic to Modern eyebrows is\ndocumented in the Plastic Surgery\nliterature also the research from 2005\nrevealed that the general public\npreferred a lower eyebrow position than\nthe high eyebrow ideal in the Plastic\nSurgery literature of the time the\ngeneral public also preferred an arch\nposition more laterally relative to the\nlateral limbus which again deviated from\nplastic surgery Norms it's not just the\nposition and Arch of the eyebrows that\nmatter though where a 2018 study found\nthat by modern standards eyebrow\nthickness matches face height and\nJawbone prominence in terms of features\nthat are more important for\nattractiveness take carela Bean's face\nas a good example of this shift in\nstandards her face is quite similar to\nGrace Kelly's but her modern Ultra thick\neyebrows clearly date her to the modern\nera big round eyes are also a defining\nfeature of classical beauty standards\nand while large eyes are of course still\nconsidered beautiful in 2023 it's not an\nessential tradeit by any means many\nmodern Beauty icons like Megan Fox have\nactually smaller more masculinized eyes\nthis change in standard reflects the\nmove towards a mix of feminine and\nmasculine features considered attractive\nfor women we see an increase in facial\nrobusticity and smaller Eyes giving a\nmore mature and socially dominant look\nto the face modern preferences for the\ntill of the eye also differ from\nclassical standards we see this with the\npopularity of the fox eye eye lift and\nthis change is also documented in the\nscientific literature cliental found\nthat those 50 and up preferred\nhorizontal eyes also known as a neutral\nCanal til while the younger group\nconsidered a raised lateral canthus of\nthe eye of 5° or an upward cter tilt as\nmore attractive so with that being said\nif you want to learn more about your own\nface and much the way we've broken it\ndown here with a lot more detail from\nour

confident about\nyourself how do you rate your looks on a\nscale of 1 to 10 we're continuing our\nSeries where we Branch out from the\nusual format and instead ask people for\na range of different different\nbackgrounds on how they feel about all\nthings related to beauty and Aesthetics\nso how do you rate your own looks is\nquite of a bit of an awkward question to\nanswer so really appreciate everyone who\nparticipates in this video as we were\nlooking back at the clips we did notice\na specific Trend in the answers that\nties in well with some of the research\nthat we've been exploring\nlately 7 out of 10 well I was going to\nsay six but I said let me just hype\nmyself up a little bit seven or eight I\nlike the way I but sometimes there are\ndays where I don't so maybe like a\n7.5 I would say seven probably say um\nseven well definitely depends on how I'm\nfeeling but probably like a seven out of\n10 I think I rate myself a seven so it\nseems that a lot of people rated\nthemselves a 7 out of 10 and this is in\nline with what we predicted after\nresearching the topic in more detail\njust taking one study as an example\nCooper atal asked unmarried University\nstudents to rate their own\nattractiveness and found most men and\nwomen also rated themselves a 7 out of\n10 when asked about the lowest possible\nattractiveness level that they would\nconsider for a potential romantic\npartner again most said a s out of 10\nI'd probably rate myself about 7even and\na half eight maybe I don't know um I\ndon't know I think that I try to make\nmyself look nice and I make an\neffort probably like a 5.5 6 maybe I\ndon't know I don't don't think I come\nunder like beauty of Standards like High\nBeauty of standards for sure but I think\nI don't find myself too bad and that's I\nthink that is exactly why I do not want\nto give myself a f i want to definitely\nbe a seven I guess NE research found\nsimilar results and went a step further\nby looking at how people rate their own\nappearance compared to the perceptions\nof others I think uh I get enough\nattention but I know I can still improve\nyou\nknow uh I think I have a nice\nsmile and I think my head and eyes go\ntogether like my freckles I think it's a\nbit something a bit different about me I\nthink I'm not conventionally beautiful I\nknow sometimes when I look at myself\nthere are certain features but I don't\nthink others would see me like maybe I\nwould see myself as eight on certain\ndays but I know others wouldn't so a\nsolid six Anan brings up a great point\non this where how we perceive ourselves\nisn't necessarily how others view us and\nwe can see this play out in a greater\nrange in to Grim's 2020 study where most\npeople rated their own looks higher with\na 6.03 out of 9 on average or a 6.7 out\nof 10 relative to the perception of\nothers being rated as 5.44 out of 9 on\naverage or roughly a 6 out of 10 so\nalmost a full point difference this Gap\nin perception was most pronounced for\nthe least attractive people in the\nsample while the most attractive\nparticipants actually underrated their\nlooks compared to outside's perceptions\nthis Gap is a pretty consistent finding\nin the literature and Matthew atal study\nprovides evidence for some\nself-awareness about this effect men in\nparticular accurately predicted other\npeople would rate them as less\nattractive but persisted in rating\nthemselves higher in spite of that\nawareness ooh uh I'd say a nine um like\nI said before I think for me sometimes I\nlike the tip my nose sometimes I don't I\nthink I don't really have the standard\nkind of features but and proportions of\nmy face but I think somehow they work\ntogether certain things I like about\nmyself certain things you know maybe I\nwould change I don't know there's\nnothing really to say but I mean some I\nwould get I'd say five pretty level\nnumber so why do we tend to overrate our\nattractiveness compared to others well\nlet's look at three possible reasons the\nfirst is let's talk about the miror\nexposure effect this is our tendency to\nlike things in this case faces more the\nmore we are exposed to them we look at\nourselves several times each day in the\nmirror so it makes sense that we would\nrate our own appearance higher than\nstrangers would consistent with this\nTheory Jeffrey hadock research showed\nyoung people who strongly value\nattractiveness rate themselves better\nlooking now compared to the Past\nsuggesting we like our own appearances\nmore over time and the more we are\nexposed to it as a generation and this\napplies not just to how how we view\nourselves but also to how we rate other\npeople's physical attractiveness on the\n1 to 10 scale anital use brain scans to\nexamine the impact of repeated exposure\non perceived attractiveness and repeated\nexposure to the same attractive or\naverage looking face activated specific\nregions in the brain and led to\nincreased attractiveness ratings so we\nrate complete strangers as less\nattractive compared to people we're more\nfamiliar with including ourselves this\nis important to keep in mind when we\nlook at these studies on attractiveness\nratings where most ratings in this case\nare given by strangers to other\nstrangers thinking about this more\nbroadly this lack of familiarity is one\nof the biggest issues with dating apps\npeople swipe left on Strangers who could\npotentially be a good match if they just\ngot to know each other first\nuh I think I'm not too bad and then I'm\nnot too great so I think eight is a\nperfect number for me I think I'm a\neight probably a solid\n8.5 and yeah I don't want to sort of do\ntoo much like a um I don't know I I'm a\nbit s of probably self cynical and I\ndon't want to Big my myself up too much\nbut yeah probably a good thing to Big on\noneself up about so yeah evolutionary\nbiologist Robert triers proposed that\nself-deception could be an evolutionary\nadaptation that improves our chances of\npassing on our genes we found some\nsupport for this theory in lal's 2014\nresearch which showed that romantic\nself-deception or raing yourself higher\nin attractiveness and desirability than\nothers do predicts romantic successful\nwomen this is comparable to the winner\neffect in the animal kingdom will be\nobserve greater success in subsequent\nfights due to a boost of confidence\nafter winning an initial fight if\npositive self-beliefs increases the\nchance of success it would make sense\nthat we would inflate our own level of\nattractiveness to likewise also increase\nthat chance I would say 10 I'm quite\nconfident with myself I love my um body\nmy features my height everything about\nme so I have no problem I think life is\ntoo short so 10\nthirdly although researchers have shown\nthat people broadly agree on who is\nattractive and who is not it's possible\nthat we focus on different traits to\nevaluate our own attractiveness compared\nto how others judge us for example a\n2015 study found that women self-\nperceived facial attractiveness was\npredicted by BMI and fluctuating\nasymmetry while men's ratings for women\nwere influenced by more neony and facial\naverageness so both men and women were\nlooking at different parts of the face\nbut nonetheless all of these things do\ncontribute to a more attractive face I\ndon't know I just feel like with me it's\nlike I don't feel I'm the greatest\nlooking guy in the world I don't feel\nlike I'm not the greatest looking guy\nI'm just like average looking or like I\ndon't really have that kind of thing to\nreally make people think I'm\ngoodlooking six I feel like I'm pretty\nbut I'm not like super beautiful like\nyeah a 9.5 pushing a 10 because I just\ndon't really care what people think\nabout me this is my face I can't really\nchange it elisia talks about not really\ncaring about what people think about her\nso how important are other people's\nopinions on when it comes to our looks\ngenerally depends a lot on who they are\nMiller and colleague showed University\nstudents were more likely to rate\nfeedback as threatening and avoid\nfeedback on their appearance when the\nratings came from close peers compared\nto low threat evaluators such as\nstudents at another University older\nadults or children compared to their own\npeers which are people you're going to\nsee face to face some sooner or later I\ndon't think I'm ugly I'm not the most\nattractive person in the world but yeah\nme personally I don't give anyone 10 cuz\n10 means perfect but I'd give myself a\ngood 8.5 or a nine you know everyone has\ntheir own opinion but that's just how I\nlook at myself so I feel like I have\nlike pretty nice distinct features that\nyou know would make me stand out so I\nnot think\nmesh together well so um I think it\ndepends like some days I I feel really\nconfident I feel like a 10 but then some\ndays like I'm not really feeling so it's\nlike six seven one issue with asking\npeople to rate themselves from 1 to 10\nis that their answers are likely\nsomewhat context dependent your opinion\nof your own attractiveness could be\ninfluenced by something as simple as\nscrolling Tik Tok or not for that\nparticular day and exposure to so many\nAttractive people all at once could\ninfluence how you feel about your own\nphysical looks we can see some evidence\nfor this in the literature where little\natal showed that exposure to attractive\nsame-sex images lowered people's\nself-rated attractiveness while exposure\nto unattractive images had the opposite\neffect this exposure effect can be even\nmore pronounced for Attractive people\nwhere a 2022 study found highly\nattractive people lowered their own\nself-rated attractiveness after looking\nat other attractive faces wearing makeup\ncompared to no makeup while these same\nimages had no effect on less attractive\nparticipants 10 man cuz I just luckily\num not not even on a sort of pretentious\nlevel um but I've always been\ncomfortable in my own skin I've always\nliked what I've seen in the mirror um\nnever had any sort of insecurities when\nit comes to my face or body or or height\nor anything um I've been blessed in a\nsense so yeah probably say um seven when\nI'm ready to be I can be an eight um but\nyeah definitely a seven just yeah just\nconfident in myself um yeah just\nconfidence I suppose 10\neven if you don't even if you you don't\nthink it deep down you have to say it\nbecause you can't project off bad energy\nabout yourself so it's always has to be\na 10 even on my worst day I'm a 10\nperiod you have to think that a manifest\nit for all yeah if you don't think\nyou're a 10 who's going to think that\nexactly so a 10 a lot of our\ninterviewers mentioned the importance of\nbeing confident in your own looks and\nthere's a good reason for this both men\nand women rate confidence as an\nimportant trait in a potential partner\nbut is there an optimal level of\nconfidence for maximizing attractiveness\nMurphy atal ran four different\nexperiments to find out and their\ninitial results show that overconfident\npeople were accurately perceived as more\nconfident which did increase\ndesirability however they were also\nperceived as arrogant which negatively\nimpacted desirability more or less\ncanceling out the effect but there are\nsome real benefits to overconfidence\nbeing overconfident was a net plus when\nit came to intrasexual competition and\nthe authors asked participants to write\ntheir own dating profile then they were\ngiven the chance to bet money on if\ntheir dating profile was more attractive\nthan another profile and the results\nshow that people were less willing to\ncompete against overconfident opponents\nwhile the overconfident ones were more\nlikely to agree to compete across the\nboard in a follow-up experiment the\nauthors found that as levels of\ncompetition increased the negative\neffects of arrogance on overall romantic\nsuccess seemed to disappear while the\npositive effects of confidence became\nstronger so the main takeaway here is\nthat overconfident people seem to have a\nsignificant romantic competitive\nAdvantage therefore it makes sense that\nwe tend to overrate our own looks\ncompared to others perceptions\n10 cuz it's me as for myself you know I\nshould see myself as a 10 out of 10 all\nfive um you know it's a good solid pass\nMark rate nothing too fancy cuz I think\nI'm cute um but yeah I put in a lot of\neffort to feel and look nice and be nice\nI think my personality also shines\nthrough\nCorin mentioned her personality and how\nit impacts the way she rates herself now\nyou might think personality is\nirrelevant when it comes to the 1 to 10\nscale particularly on looks but we came\nacross some significant studies showing\nthat personality genuinely does\ninfluence our perceptions of physical\nattractiveness looks look at one of\nthose studies where kongal divided 120\npeople into three groups and asked them\nto rate 60 women's attractiveness 2\nweeks later they rated the same faces\nagain this time with positive negative\nor no personality information there was\na significant boost in rated\nattractiveness for those with a positive\npersonality and a decrease in rating for\nthose with a negative personality trait\nascribed to them and another 2023 study\nadded to this body of research showing\nthat perceived honesty boosts physical\nattractiveness ratings for both men and\nwomen the impact of Personality un\nperceived physical attractiveness and\nalso the mere exposure effect helps to\nexplain why so many couples start out as\nfriends hunal showed that couples who\nhad been friends before dating had much\nlower attractiveness correlations range\nof 020 and 40 compared to those who had\nformed relationships soon after meeting\nattractiveness correlations of .52 and\n70 meaning that the more attractive\ncouples tend to start straight into a\nrelationship and the less attractive\nones tend to go from Friendship to\nrelationship this is another reason why\nwe might rate our own attractiveness\nhigher compared to a stranger's\nassessment because we're more familiar\nwith our positive personality traits and\nthat influences our perceptions of the\nway that we look"}]}

before humans\ndisplay a preference for coin affilia or\naveraged faces meaning that those faces\nthat are closest to the average of a\ncomposite from say a population like the\nimages here are considered more\nattractive while a heavily average face\nis pleasing to the eye it's not\nnecessarily an exceptionally beautiful\nor striking or memorable face and we\ncall this the blank canvas effect where\na blank canvas is free from\nimperfections but it's not as\ninteresting as a stunning artwork in\nfact composits of faces judged to be the\nmost attractive defer significantly\ncompared to composits of average faces\nfacial Harmony is not enough when it\ncomes to the upper echelons of beauty\nand horal notes that the most beautiful\nface in addition to being both high in\nSymmetry and averageness also contain a\nfew select striking features that sets\nthem apart from the rest one example is\nthe significantly large distance between\nAna Taylor Joy's eyes which contributes\nto her striking ethereal and Hyper\nfeminized look while this adds to her\nattractiveness striking features don't\nalways have a positive impact on one's\nlooks a characteristic could also be\nmore memorable for the wrong reasons\nnamely if it disrupts facial Harmony One\nsuch 2014 study found that even\nunattractive faces are more memorable\nthan attractive faces but which specific\nfeatures actually makes your face more\nmemorable For Better or For Worse our\nteam identified five key traits that\nmakes your face look striking and we're\ngoing to talk about them in this video\nsee if you have any of them yourself and\ntry to recall how many people you've\nactually met with these traits and if\nyou actually remember them or not a\nhighly exaggerated can or tilt which is\nthe degree of tilt between the two\ncorners of the eye is a rare trait that\ncan make your face appear striking even\njust slightly accentuating the medial C\nor tilt results in 93% higher ratings of\nattractiveness according to research by\ngu to tell while while dramatically\nexaggerated cander tilts can have a\nsubstantial impact on beauty the authors\nof this study propose that a striking up\nwith till is responsible for celebrities\nlike Jennifer Connelly and CLA Fan's\nexceptional Beauty whose faces otherwise\nfall into the harmonious average\nfeatures category of attractiveness as a\nneotenous and sexually dimorphic trait\nthe benefit of a more upturn Cano tilt\nare actually greater for women than for\nmen but how dramatic does this cat eye\neffect need to be to actually count as\nstriking in once a 2023 study they used\nAI to analyze the facial proportions of\n42 highly attractive Caucasian\ncelebrities commonly featured in The\nMost Beautiful List and to determine how\nhighly attractive male and female faces\ndeviate from each other in the general\npopulation this study was pretty\nsignificant celebrities of both sexes\nmeasured significantly greater average\ntilt of 8.5 for women and 6.5 de for men\ncompared to an average of say 4.12 in\nThe Wider Caucasian population and we\nactually see this in every other\npopulation as well with the attractive\nvariant of their population having\nexaggerated tilt from Rial study\ninterestingly the results for these\nattractive Caucasian celebrity women are\ncloser to the average cter tilt of\nattractive Korean faces measuring at\n8.87 in Wu's research and average Korean\nfaces displayed an even higher tilt\nangle of 9.77 meaning that they have\nsome of the highest most dramatic tilted\neyes of any population suggesting a\ndiminishing return to Upward turning\neyes Beyond a certain point where more\ndoesn't necessarily make it more\nattractive it just has to be more than\nthe population average but this limit\nwill obviously vary by ethnic group as\nthe most attractive African faces\nexceeded the measurement of average\nKorean faces coming in at 9.98 De which\nis a dramatic deviation from the African\naverage face till of 5.39 upturned eyes\nare clearly a striking trait if the till\nangle deviates dramatically from the\naverage from that population but it's\nnot a me break feature ey shape and ey\nmorphology are also very important\ncharacteristics and plus many of these\nbeautiful celebrities actually have\ndownturned eyes including Jacob El Lordi\nand an haway so it's not the most\nimportant but it is one of the more\nimportant ones as we've identified in\nour previous list on what people notice\non a face first as we've previously\ndiscussed on the channel there is no\ncross-cultural preference for any\nparticular eye color because this highly\ndepends on the geographic region we're\nlooking at poal highlights that some\ncultures prefer brown eyes while others\nprefer lighter eyes and a 2010 study\nconfirmed that altering eye color on\nphotographs from a typical blue shade to\na typical Brown shade actually had no\nimpact on rated attractiveness but what\ndid have an impact was the shape of the\neye itself light eyes are fairly common\nand even the norm in northern Europe and\nas such they have a preference for brown\neyes being the determining Factor that's\ndifferent from the population average as\nsuch the average light eye color doesn't\nreally appear striking when everybody\nelse has the same eye color it takes a\ntruly unique Hue of the iris to give a\nstriking appearance to the face and we\ncan take Angelina Jolie as an example\nher large lips along with their\nprominent cheekbones and jawline\narguably contribute much to her unique\nattractiveness more so than her lighter\neye color now say for example Angelina's\nface to someone like Killian Murphy\nwhere Killian also has a similar\nprominent bone structure and plump lips\nbut his exceptionally light eyes stand\nout in a way that Angelina's eyes do not\nso much so that the intensity of his\npiercing eyes in the 2023 Oppenheimer\nmovie became even a meme on Tik Tok if a\ncaricature artist drew Angelina's face\nher eye color wouldn't fact a much into\nthe drawing but Killian's eyes would and\nthat's what we're trying to get at\nexceptionally light eyes are obviously\nmore memorable but are they necessarily\nmore attractive it's likely quite a\ndivisive trait and the scientific\nliterature hints at possible reasons why\nunusual eye colors from the population\naverage could be considered more\nattractive it all depends on the\ngeographical region negative frequency\ndependent selection refers to a tradeit\nthat is more attractive the less common\nit is Brook atel cites a number of\nstudies noting that rare adornments or\ncolor patterns positively impact\nattractiveness and Ming success in the\nanimal kingdom potentionally because\nadding rare traits to the gene pool\nmaintains healthy Gene gentic diversity\nin the population group so piercing\nlight eyes could be attractive purely\nbecause they're rare alternatively\nresearch shows that a brighter Scara\nwhich is the white part of the eye is an\nindicator of both Youth and health and\nthose with lower levels of melanin like\nthose with extremely light eyes are more\nlikely to have a white Scara as they're\nnot as susceptible to Brown scar spots\nstriking eyes are not exclusive to Blue\nShades or Caucasian populations either\nin fact possibly the most noteworthy\nmemorable eyes belong to shabbat Gula\nThe Afghani girl whose National\nGeographic picture when viral because of\nher striking green eyes Jesse Williams\nis also known for his light eye color\nwhile Model Eva Marcel is an example of\nsomeone with unusually light brown eyes\nstriking eyes could be particularly\nattractive for women with deeper skin\ntones as's a high level of contrast\nbetween the eyes and the skin is\nconsidered a youthful and sexually\ndimorphic trait what do conventional\nfashion models have in common besides\nheight and leanness exceptional bone\nstructure is also essential for modeling\nparticularly the combination of\nprominent cheekbones with a strong\nrobust sheline and this preference for\nfacial robust ticity seems to be a very\nWestern Centric preference Believe It or\nNot Your cheekbones alone could be the\ndifferentiating factor between being\nconsidered Q or having a striking\nmodelesque face as we've covered in many\nvideos on this topic in the past Jones\natel showed that female models have\nhyper neotenous features compared to\ntheir peers but it's their striking bone\nstructure that prevents models from\nfalling into the cute category or the\nGirl Next Door category unsurprisingly\northodontic expert RJ Elder identified\nthis exact type of face neotonus in the\ncenter with mature features like Pro and\ncheekbones at the outer edges in the\nmost attractive women cheekbone\nprominence is a mature facial feature is\nof course also important for men with\ncunning him AAL identifying prominent\ncheekbones as one of the key overall\ndeterminant of male attractiveness just\nlike the Cal tilt it's no surprise that\nattractive celebrities have\nsignificantly wider cheekbones for the\nwidth of the face compared to average\npeople measuring at 14 for men and 13\nfor attractive women compared to around\nnine for average men and women high and\nwide cheekbones are a modelesque feature\nthat can help help your face stand out\nand this is especially true when paired\ntogether with a strong jawline as we've\ndiscussed previously on the channel the\njaw is the most important facial feature\nfor attractiveness but robust\nwell-developed jaw lines are rare in\nmost modern population this is largely\nbecause soft modern diets prevent proper\nfacial development early on in life with\na large proportion of the modern\npopulation actually having some level of\nMal occlusion or improper facial\ndevelopment in fact only about 30% of us\nhave perfect occlusion which\nsignificantly impacts our Dent facial\ndevelopment and it's easy to see why\nreally strong facial development is\nactually quite rare if you have a\nwell-developed jaw line you will stand\nout in 2023 even if je lines like yours\nwere the norm for our ancestors just 100\nyears ago the Striking features covered\nup until now tend to increase your\nattractiveness but the next might have\nthe opposite effect at least in Western\ncultures but it is certainly undeniably\nvery striking a gap between the two\nfront teeth known as a diastema in the\nliterature is a divisive yet certainly\nstriking facial trait rodrig atal 2009\nexamined the influence of teeth exposure\non smiling attractiveness and found all\nfive smile types received positive\nratings except just one the smile with a\n1 mm wide tooth gap between the front\nteeth perhaps large tooth gaps are not\nso appealing to the average person but\nit is a popular feature in the modeling\nindustry British model Georgia May\nJagger's tooth Gap is her most\ndistinctive trait and America's Next Top\nModel contestant Chelsea Hurley even had\nher tooth Gap widen on Tyra Bank's\norders during cycle 15 of the show as\nwe've noted on the channel the Victoria\nSecret angels of the early 2010s all had\na similar look and Jessica heart's tooth\ncapap helped her stand out especially\nfrom a look alike Ain Heatherton and\nLily Donaldson who all walk the same\n2012 annual Victoria Secret fashion show\ntogether outside of the Western World\nopinions on tooth gaps quite strongly\nvary the 2023 Malaysian sample\nconsidered some tooth gaps attractive\nbut opinions varied by demographic\noverall a tooth capap of5 mm was\nconsidered aesthetically pleasing while\ngaps of 4 mm looked unattractive and\nwere deemed to require treatment the\nmajority of Nigerian women in a 2015\nselected sample considered tooth caps\nbeautiful and desired an artificially\ncreated tooth Gap from themselves and on\nthe other hand Al shami and colleague\nshowed that a sample of jordanians\nconsider tooth gaps unattractive and\ndeem them worthy of closure most of the\nother striking features on this list are\ngenetically determined but here's one\nyou might have a strong influence on\nover yourself your hair could be\nstriking for many different reasons it\nhas a unique texture a thickness a rare\ncolor either natural or unnatural or an\nunusual length but perhaps the most\nstriking hairstyle choice for women is\nthe absence of hair itself the choice to\ngo bold is a little extreme but a\nminority of young women do choose to\nwear their hair quite short and this can\nhelp them stand out depending on their\nfacial archetype perhaps best\nillustrated by Audrey heurn who was\nknown for the contrast between her Ultra\nfeminine middle face features and her\npixie haircut created the gamine\narchetype in a similar way Jason Mamoa\ncan easily pull off long hair which is\nconsidered more feminine in our society\nthanks to his otherwise High hper\nmasculine appearance we know that a\nshorter haircut is striking for women\nbut does it actually impact your\nphysical attractiveness mesal confirmed\nthat men rated medium and longer lengths\nof hair as significantly more attractive\nand healthier short hair decreased\nattractiveness for women with both\nfeminine or masculine faces but\nattractive women with short hair was\nstill considered better looking than\nwomen with less attractive faces and\nlonger hair even though a shorter cut\ncan decrease perceptions of beauty pixie\ncuts are quite common in the modeling\nindustry to create a more striking look\nshort haircuts as part of a makeover\nwere popular on America's desktop model\nincluding for Cassandra jeene a passion\nQueen from cycle 5 whose face was\nclassically beautiful with few truly\nstriking traits described as safe and\nBland Tyra Banks gave her a pixie cut\nfor an edgier appearance you can see why\nthis is a benefit for

felt that you\nwere taken as attractive in this video\nwe're going to cover a very significant\nimpact of physical attractiveness the\npsychology part of attractiveness the\nbiases of beauty that influence how we\nlook at people and treat them we're\ngoing to explore the reasons why\nattractive individuals tend to have\neasier lives out of not everything as as\nperfect as it seemed we've covered this\nin many podcast episodes that there are\nalso deleterious disadvantages to being\nphysically attractive but we can also\nargue that those advantages are still\nless worse than being physically\nunattractive when it comes to Inner\nwell-being research by Gupta and\ncolleagues suggest that individuals with\ngreater facial and bodily attractiveness\ntend to experience higher levels of\nwell-being being and overall Mental\nHealth on the other hand lower\nattractiveness is often associated with\nhigher levels of distress and depression\nwhile this doesn't necessarily mean that\nall less attractive individuals are\nunhappy it does highlight a general\nTrend attractive individuals tend to\nfeel better with their lives and\nexperience greater happiness perhaps\nbecause they are better treated\nthroughout their lives by Society this\nincludes a lower propensity towards\nsocial anxiety which brings us to the\nnext point we already know that\nattractiveness plays a significant role\nin social interactions it will tend to\nsubconsciously associate desirable\nsocial traits with attractiveness such\nas being more competent confident and\nsocially skilled they have a higher\nlikelihood of winning arguments and\npersuading others to change their\nopinions just imagine the impact that\nattractiveness can have in situations\nsuch as political debates or convincing\na customer to make a purchase in\naddition attractive individuals are more\nlikely to receive assistance from others\nwhich is something we witness in our\ndaily lives they also generally receive\nbetter treatment overall this can also\nhave significant consequences in life as\nresearched by Michael F Brandt showed\nwhere jurors can be influenced by the\nphysical attractiveness of both the\naccused and the victim and something as\ncritical as the outcome of a trial\nwhether a person is declared guilty or\ninnocent can still be influenced by\ntheir physical attractiveness there is\nthis fascinating self-fulfilling\nprophecy effect linked to attractiveness\nin social situations an example from\nCinder a towel study in a study where\nmen had phone conversations with women\nbelieving them to be either physically\nattractive or unattractive women who are\nperceived unknown to them as physically\nattractive behaved in a more sociable\noutgoing and warm manner in other words\nwhen men believed that they were talking\nto attractive women they treated them\nbetter which in turn resulted in women\nresponding by being nicer as well the\neffects of attractiveness on social life\nstart from Early Childhood when the\nfirst significant interactions occur at\nschool teachers are no different from\nany other person they tend to respond\nmore favorably to attractive students\ntheir perceptions of children are often\ninfluenced by factors unrelated to a\nchild's abilities such as character and\nof course attractiveness this is\nsignificant because teachers perceptions\nfilter down to the students and this is\nwhat forms the basis of their\nself-perception self-esteem motivation\nengagement in school and academic\nachievement which we all know do have\nimpacts in later life in this sense a\npaper by Christine Hansen demonstrated\nthat attractive children are often\ntreated differently by teachers thereby\nboosting their confidence and leading to\nbetter academic performance\nin addition Westville atal showed that\ntrack of instructors are associated with\nBetter Learning outcomes and that\nstudents consider them as more capable\nand persuasive to listen to as well this\nmeans that students with more attractive\ninstructors tend to perform better on\nlearning tasks one possible explanation\nfor these findings is that attractive\ninstructors capture more attention from\nthe students interestingly the\nattractiveness Factor also works in the\nopposite direction viniola atal showed\nthat attractive University instructors\ntend to receive higher evaluations from\nstudents this suggests that students\nassess teachers not only by their\nteaching abilities but also take their\nappearance into account this can have\nimportant implications such as\ninfluencing decisions on Professor\npromotions and salary increases which\noften consider student ratings into\naccount just consider mathematics\nteacher Pietro bacelli who also happens\nto be a professional male model as well\ndo attractive individuals also enjoy an\nadvantage when it comes to getting a job\nwell absolutely attractive individuals\nare more likely to get hired promoted\nand earn higher salaries starting with\nthe job application process what can\nzatel found that attractiveness did not\nsignificantly affect the likelihood of\ngetting the job when the application was\nof high quality however an attractive\nphotograph boosted the evaluations of\nthe applicant when the application was\nnot as good this suggests that being\nattractive can compensate for a lack of\nqualifications and supports the idea\nthat attractive individuals even if less\ncompetent can still benefit from their\nappearance in the labor market in terms\nof salaries attractiveness has profound\neffects according to research by Matt\nBeret who revealed that attractive\nservers earned significantly higher tips\nthan unattractive servers this indicates\nthat customers tend to be more generous\nin their tipping when they find the\nserver attractive consider your own\nexperiences are you more likely to give\na better tip to an attractive waiter or\nwaitress while the findings may seem\nbiased as image is an important factor\nin the service industry similar results\nhave been found in other non-image-based\nprofessions Charlton colleagues reveal\nthat attractive high school graduates\nearned higher incomes in their\nunattractive counterparts through out\ntheir lives even into their early 50s\nregardless of their chosen profession\nthis reveals a significant positive\neffect of attractiveness on the expected\nincomes of an individual and in short\nattractiveness is a positive trait that\nis directly valued and rewarded in the\nlabor market because it is directly\nvalued in society which can be perceived\nas a productive characteristic just like\nany other ability such as your height\nyour speed your intelligence your\nstrength and so on despite the\nadvantages that attractive individuals\ngenerally experience there are some\nexceptions and downsides to being very\nattractive firstly the advantage\nexperienced by attractive individuals do\nnot universally apply in certain\ncontexts such as rural communities where\nsocial dynamics differ from those of\nurban areas the benefits typically\nassociated with attractiveness may not\nhold true research conducted by plow\nital suggests that in these environments\nattractive individuals do not\nnecessarily live Easier lives this is\nbecause unlike in urban settings where\nattractiveness is valued in a free\nmarket of relationships more close-knit\ncommunities with different values do not\nprioritize attractiveness in the same\nway another exception to the positive\neffects of attractiveness occur in this\nrealm of decision making when a person\nis evaluated by someone of the same sex\nattractiveness hurts them rather than\nhelping Agatha atal found that people\nwere less likely to recommend highly\nattractive same-sexed individuals for a\njob or for admissions into University\nthese negative responses to attractive\nsame-sex individuals may stem from\nperceptions of self-threat meaning that\nevaluators may view attractive\nindividuals as potential competitors\nanother interesting scenario occurs in\nthe world of online dating where there\ncan also be some downsides to being very\nattractive particularly for women at\nleast according to McLane and colleagues\nthey revealed that men perceived highly\nattractive female profiles as less\ntrustworthy which reveals a negative\nassociation between attractiveness and\nauthenticity in the context of online\ndating it is possible that men become\nsuspicious that extremely attractive\nwomen have misrepresented their\nappearances or are not going to be\nfaithful risk such has indeed indicated\nthat women are more likely to\nmisrepresent their looks to gain\nattention especially online likely due\nto the societal gender pressures so to\nclose this out attractiveness is a\nvaluable asset in life and it's one that\nwe should all try to pursue at least to\nsome degree when we're still young and\nfull of energy attractive individuals\ntend to experience greater happiness\nmore fulfilling social lives better\ntreatment in job situations and also\nperforming better in education with\nbetter access to Opportunities and\nhigher salaries while there may be a few\nspecific contextual disadvantages there\nis no doubt that the pros of being\nattractive certainly outweigh

"assistant", "content": "natural beauty something that appears\nunadulterated or Untouched by man-made\nadvances on Tick Tock there was once a\ntrend where someone would try to\nidentify as either natural pretty or\npopular pretty the two are notably\ndifferent but what contributes to the\nNatural Beauty look well in this video\nwe'll take a look at what gives a face\nan appearance that is effortless yet raw\nand attractive the first point of\ncontention are the eyebrows and the\neyebrows can actually change a lot about\na face which most people don't really\nrealize until we show them before and\nafters but here what type of brow\ncreates a more seamlessly natural\nappearance we can easily see that\nsomeone like Cara Delevingne has a very\nstriking brows not only are they quite\ndark they seem perfectly shaped and\nmolded this doesn't give her a natural\nlook per se but Riley gives her a more\nbold curated Beauty you can even look at\nthe Kardashians and see how perfectly\nmolded their brows appear and they are\nknown for having a more altered curated\nappearance in contrast Jennifer Connelly\nhas dark brows as well but her brows\naren't as perfectly molded to fit a\ncertain shape she kept their natural\nbushy almost unruly and natural Flair\nwith their own set of minor asymmetries\nkeeping your own natural brow shape will\nallow for a more effortless type of\nbeauty assuming they're within some\nlevel of reasonable proportion eyebrows\nthat contribute to the Natural Beauty\neffect are often more asymmetrical the\nasymmetry makes it seem as though little\nto not much work has been put into the\nappearance even though you and I both\nknow there has been a level of work that\nstill goes into maintaining aesthetic\nlooking eyebrows if you want the fls\nbrow look you can easily use your own\nnatural brow shape and just use an\neyebrow tending kit to darken the Brows\nwhile also going to a brow specialist to\nadd some minor Corrections this will\ncreate a natural brow shape while still\nusing the higher contrast or a striking\neffect depending on your skin tone now\nalthough there is a buccal fat removal\nTrend that creates a certain augmented\nlook let's say A Lena face can allow for\na more natural Contour that won't need\nto be recreated using makeup naturally\nlean faces don't require as much makeup\nas puffier ones because the built-in\nshading is already there as a bone\nstructure she creates Contours of\nvalleys and Peaks amongst the\nsurrounding tissue if one already has a\nnice amount of facial following they may\naccentuate it using a bit of Contour\nwhereas someone with more facial fat\nwould have to rely on heavier contouring\nand lighting or sculpted appearance and\nthe makeup never really compares to the\nreal thing now bird structure also goes\nhand in hand with facial leanness\ncertain bone structures can have facial\nhollowing while some cannot achieve that\nlook no matter how lean they get simply\nbecause their facial features are not\nprominent enough the underlying bone\nstructure does matter if you want to\nlearn more about why certain faces can\nnever have facial hollowing lean cheeks\na really sharp sculpted appearance you\ncan check out this video with the truth\nabout sharp cheekbones we will break\ndown cheekbone Anatomy from a physical\nperspective but for now bone structures\nwith prominent High set cheekbones\ncombined with a well-developed jaw can\nhave this certain look with virtually no\nmakeup and that contributes to the\neffortlessly beautiful face because it\ncontributes to the beauty standard but\nalso doesn't require extra augmentation\nagain when you have naturally strong\nstrong robust facial development you\nreally won't need to opt for heavy\nmakeup which in turn creates the natural\nbeauty effect when it comes to\nproportions having ones that are more\nclinically ideal contributes to the\nNatural Beauty effect if we have more\nquote unquote ideal proportions say in\nrelation to your racial group your\nethnic group even your biological sex\nyou won't have to find ways to distract\nfrom other ones for example using a\nliner to accentuate the fullness of a\nthin uplift because you already have a\ndecently voluminous lip in South Korean\nbeauty culture the under eyelid fat is\noften called egg yourself and this can\ncreate an illusion of a smaller more\ncompacted face shape as the overall eyes\nlook larger and more youthful which is\nin line with their beauty standard along\nthe same line as the lips if an\nindividual has a longer field trim they\ncould easily use lip liner to make the\nphiltrum appear shorter by over lining\nthe lips but of course one with a\nshorter field trim wouldn't need to over\nline like that because they already have\nthe preferred feature in that sense the\nlack of Reliance on makeup would be\ncontributing to the Natural Beauty\neffect proportions are the main part of\nthe natural effect because according to\nresearch by Dr Langlois and Dr rogman\nattractive faces are only average both\nmale and female Composites were judged\nas more attractive than almost all of\nthe individual faces comprising the\nComposites this obviously doesn't mean\nthat very attractive people are average\nin the sense that most people would\nunderstand the word it means that their\nfacial proportions would not lie on any\nnumerical extremes on the bell curve of\nproportions and rather they stay within\nthe averaged rage the Greeks coined this\nterm coinophilia anything truly natural\nisn't necessarily Perfect Look at\nnatural Woods natural marbles they all\nhave their own imperfections yet we pay\ntop dollar for them we all have some\nblemishes on our faces and this is\nespecially important when we're talking\nabout skin you will notice that in\neastern Beauty cultures a lot of\ncelebrities have extremely smooth skin\npretty much to the point where it seems\nimpossible to achieve this level of skin\nsmoothness has been criticized for not\nappearing quote unquote natural\ninterestingly enough there were certain\nmakeup trends in Japan that attempted to\nappear more natural by leaving the skin\nwith small marks or deliberate\nimperfections like acne scarring or\nmoles being artificially added back in\nin places they considered more aesthetic\nyou can see that someone like hoyan Jung\nwho has garnered attention by Western\nstandards and Western audiences doesn't\nhave that certain smoothing skin you see\nin traditional K-pop Idols she has her\nlittle blemishes like everyone else and\nthis contributes to her appeal as being\na natural icon records can also\ncontribute to this Natural Beauty look\ndespite your skin color and World\nnatural ones of course are considered\nquite attractive within reason basically\nshowing the quirks of your skin such as\nmelanocytes moles even solar lesions and\nwithin reason help one achieve a more\nnatural beauty look because it is\nultimately where your skin realistically\nlooks like with minimal makeup you can\nopt for a lighter coverage Foundation if\nyou want to achieve a more homogenous\nundertone But ultimately natural look\nrelates back to a lack of makeup the\nlips actually do matter a fair bit when\nit comes to the Natural Beauty look\nbecause the lips act as a sort of\nshibboleth from when we transition from\nnatural beauty to more than up looks the\nidea being that since the lips provide a\npoint of high contrast basically with\nlipsticks trying to emulate the redness\nof the lips having more pale natural lip\ntones is indicative of a lower usage of\nmakeup even if that's not true we\nconsider the lips just as a layperson to\nbe the indicator of when the look is\nmore done up or if there is a lack of\nlip tones that are aggressive or very\nhigh contrast the face is considered to\nbe less stunner just a very big\nsimplification but hopefully you get the\npoint there the idea being it doesn't\nreally have much to do with the fullness\nof the lips but rather the keyhole power\na trait that's found in certain lips\nwhere there will be a little Keyhole and\nmany do get this lip surgically\naugmented and altered to get this\nstraight this tray itself will\ncontribute to a more dramatic sensual\nBeauty moving away from the natural\nideals a face with a more natural look\ntends to have a wider and less\nvoluminous lip shape in old Hollywood\nthere were a lot more stars with less\nplastic surgery compared to the average\nHollywood star today but if that is the\ncase why do most of them still have this\nglamorous look and not the Natural\nBeauty look well for one they had more\nHigh arched brows that contributed to\nthat glamor prominent brow arches can\ngive a face more Flair making it look\nmore like the diva of the time they also\nhad more facial fat and less prominent\nbone structure including the Jaws\ncompared to models or actors today and\nof course with the exception of say\nSharon Tate Bridget Bardot and Audrey\nHepburn we still see that continued\noverall you will notice the brows and\nburn structures notably change the\nbeauty type all the way back in the\nHollywood days the use of makeup was\nmore overt messy many no makeup\ntutorials on YouTube look of being more\nnatural relies on more genetically\ngifted proportions bone structures and\nfeatures rather than the Reliance on\nmakeup the reason this quote unquote\nNatural Beauty look is so appealing is\nbecause overt use of makeup\nunfortunately does have negative\nconnotations one proposed reason for\nthis is because makeup is essentially\nacts as a dishonest indicator of genetic\nfitness what does that mean you may ask\nwell in Social biology we consider\ncertain features to be honest indicators\nof genetic fairness for example not\nhaving acne is an indicator to everyone\naround you that you are free of that\nskin disease I want you to be pretty\nobvious having misshapen eyes having\ntumors asymmetries malformations is\nindication of poor facial development so\nagain it's an honest indicator because\nyou can't really hide say a missing\nJewel or a very asymmetric face with\nmakeup but makeup on the other hand can\nmimic some smaller indicators of your\nFitness such as blush or Rouge adding\nredness to the cheeks which is\nindicative of typically healthy men and\nwomen or for example using brow pens to\ndarken the Brows which is again\nsynonymous with youthfulness because our\nbrows do lose their color as we get\nolder so that could be why heavy makeup\nis considered sort of cheating the\nsystem although the usage of makeup is\nultimately up to the person some people\ndo it just because it makes them feel\nfeel more confident Others May do it\nbecause they understand it can give them\na social boost as well both reasons are\ncompletely valid while there was\nabsolutely nothing wrong with using\nmakeups to feel comfortable with\nyourself you should be wary of ill usage\nor over dramatic Styles in your\nday-to-day life if you're trying to look\nfor the benefits of the natural look and\nwhat are these benefits well typically\nthere is also a classes element to the\naesthetic archetype that you take for\nyourself for example typically richer\nmore affluent people go for the more\nnatural look and the reason for this is\nquite simple maintaining Perfect Skin\nperfect hair perfect facial features\nsuch as eating healthy is not cheap in\nany way so you don't need to use makeup\nto emulate those things again this idea\nof the dishonest genetic indicator\nbecause ultimately those that can afford\nit only to emulate it there are many\ndifferent eye shapes but certain ones\ndon't have the natural beauty effect\nbecause not all eye shapes are made\nequal for instance vertically narrower\nsharper eyes will be more molest or\nFierce and perhaps more intimidating but\ncertainly not contributing to the\nnatural look because most women\nnaturally don't have those eyes those\nare more masculinized eyes that we see\nmore commonly on men slightly more\nrounded eyes with a wider eye opening\nalso called the palpable height a more\nfresh-faced which in turn creates the\nNatural Beauty look because this is more\ncommon or typical of what we would\nexpect to see two rounded or large eyes\nwon't give this effect because again\nthey stray into the other end of the\nspectrum where the eyes are hyper\nfeminized and again this is an effect\nthat's perhaps commonly done with makeup\nbut also rare to see on a naturally\nfresh face the Natural Beauty look\ndoesn't lean too heavily on either end\nit Embraces the natural eye shape that\nmost people women particularly have in\nthis context regardless without makeup\nit will be more neutral and not overtly\naggressive or docile such as the dull\nlook from the extremely rounded eyes may\nslide a bit more on either Spectrum\ndepending on the archetype of your face\nbut normally it doesn't lie on either\nextreme and that's the main takeaway\nhere but the natural beauty effect the\neyes won't be so overly wide set because\nthat would offer or otherworldly effect\nwhich is again a different aesthetic\nfantasy characters like fairies are\noften depicted with very wide say eyes\nwhich isn't really the natural look\nwe're aiming for because again the name\nof the game is staying within facial\naverages more normal to slightly wide\nset eyes would offer the Natural Beauty\nlook and there is research that shows\nhaving slightly wider eyes than you'd\nexpect it's actually quite a desirable\nlook especially in the modeling industry\nin helping explain the Natural Beauty\nlook we should also try to explain why\nsome people look otherworldly or\nethereal word ethereal means extremely\ndelicate and light in a way that seems\ntoo perfect for this world basically\nethereal looks describes something that\ndoesn't seem real and is captured by\nperhaps some distinctly non-average\nfacial proportions and features one\nexample that comes to mind for me\npersonally is suneno a artist that we\ncovered on this channel with an\nextremely unusual nose bridge that\ndefinitely adds some uniqueness to the\nface ethereal faces will also have high\nlevels of neonate features that are\nfound in infants typically adding to the\nuncanniness of their effect according to\nsexual selection physical attractiveness\nand facial neotony by Doug Jones\njuvenile mammals present a\ncharacteristic cute appearance with\nrelatively large Eyes eye foreheads and\nreduced snouts when you have a\ncombination of all of these traits\ntogether as an adult you will end up\nwith more of an otherworldly appearance\nas opposed to one with a natural beauty\nlook because this is again not typical\nof most women in this context or if all\nmen in this context because most people\ngrow out of their young features high\namounts of facial fat are also found in\nbabies are children so having more of\nthat might also contribute to the\nEthereal type rather than the natural or\nthe more Model S looks which prefer\nfacial robusticity or sharpness and\nangularity as stated before natural\nfacial Contour will also add to the\nbeauty effect so what type of facial\narchetype is best there are so many\ndifferent ways to be attractive and the\nNatural Beauty look is only one of them\nthat is contextually quite modern only\nwith the Advent and popularization of\nsurgery within the last 200 years for\ncosmetic purposes do we have to make the\ndistinction between natural beauty and I\ndon't know done up Beauty popular pretty\nwhat whatever terms the kids are using\nthese days and so it actually makes a\nsignificant distinction when we talk\nabout natural beauty and why it's\nimportant because it's tied in this\nclass's root where typically again\nricher people tend to opt for the\nnatural look as opposed to the done up\nglamorous look simply because it is a\nstatus symbol to have perfectly clear\nskin without having to use makeup to\nhave nice hair down up nails so on and\nso forth the Natural Beauty look is\ncreated by a few different factors as\nwe've covered with the examples and not\none type of beauty or archetype is\nsuperior to the others because then\nyou're comparing apples to oranges if\nyou're interested in recreating the\neffect yourself you can try to follow\nthe tips mentioned in this video but\nthis is more of a discussion for makeup\nchannels because ultimately there is\nstill a level of makeup just very light\nFoundation that goes into achieving the\nlook without looking overdone but\nthere's also elements of facial features\nthat are more averaged or coin affiliate\nclick for the population rather than\nthose that are more model-esque or\nperhaps docile or perhaps ethereal or\notherworldly by being on completely\ndifferent end of the spectrum\nrealistically the Natural Beauty look\nisn't something that's achievable for\neveryone think about it there's only so\nmuch you can change about your facial\nproportions your genetics your facial\nrobusticity or development and so the\nidea comes down to not relying on\nsurgery where if you did use surgery to\nchange these things then it really\nwouldn't be natural beauty anymore but\nthat being said in the other end of the\nspectrum more people can achieve this\nlook than they thought because a lot of\npeople do have those features naturally\nthe idea of natural beauty goes down to\njust looking like your normal self with\na slight bit of enhancement nothing over\nthe top so maybe you can pull that look\noff it just depends on your specific\nface if you want to learn more about\nyour face just like we've covered here\nin a lot of depth from our team of\ndoctors and dentists then have I got the\nperfect solution for you head

that modeling may or may not be for\nyou and that's okay modeling isn't for\neveryone but it does affect all of our\nlives in some fashion you just can't\nmiss the Intrigue and polarizing\naesthetic that the fashion industry\ncarries nowadays if you scroll through\nyour for you page or YouTube shorts\nyou're bound to come across someone\ntelling you how to become a model what\nagencies are looking for and so on given\nthe aura of Mystique and exclusivity\naround the modeling world it's clear to\nunderstand why people want to learn how\nto become one in this video we'll be\nidentifying the specific facial features\nthat modeling agencies are looking for\nthis year and will likely even delve\ninto 2024's predictions we'll first try\nto cover our journey and exposure to the\nmodeling World until this point and some\nbroader well-known features that\nagencies I've always been looking for\nand towards the end of the video we'll\ntry to answer the question how does this\naffect you as a consumer of fashion\nbrands or just an observer of the\nconstantly shifting beauty trends in the\nfashion industry\nin the past on the channel we've made a\nlot of modeling related content we've\ntalked to female and male models such as\nCarl kugelman and interviewed different\nfounders of different agencies and we\nare generally quite exposed to the\nfashion industry as a whole due to the\nnature of our works on Aesthetics\ntalking with them did give us a deal of\ninsight into the current state of\nmodeling at the time but now we want to\nset our sights for the future we\nrecognize the criteria to be a model is\nquite selective just to give you a taste\nof that selectivity our team decided to\ngo to some of the top agency management\nsites such as Elite models and just\ngather some of the stats on the heights\nof 98 female models that made up the Los\nAngeles division of their agency\nunsurprisingly of the 98 models the\nminimum height was 5'7 and the tallest\nwere 5 11. while we would certainly\nexpect some messing around of the\nnumbers as agencies don't want to Market\nmodels that are either too short or too\ntall to their clientele this actually\ngives us an even better idea of the\nheight ranges that agencies actually do\nwant the average height was five foot\nnine and three quarters while the most\ncommon height and the median worth five\nfoot ten either way you get the point\nthat models are above average tall\npreferably it seems like being right\naround five nine to five eleven for\nfemale models is the sweet spot where\nmost bottles lie that is already well\nwithin the top one to two percent of\nfemale Heights in the United States and\nlet's assume that they also are looking\nfor a face that is within the top two to\nten percent of attractiveness as well\nthen the chances of possessing the\ncriteria to be a model at least at Elite\nis approximately one in 2500 and that's\nbeing quite generous if you want to have\na better chance than b511 with a highly\nattractive face and the trendy features\nthat we're going to discuss for example\nYasmine windelim then this could easily\nskew towards being one in a hundred\nthousand people or even greater simply\nput the industry is very selective and\nbeing a model or a Top Model is\nrelatively rare even without our\nexperience on the matter the average\nlayperson can tell that the modeling\nindustry has been shifting in recent\nyears all you have to do is look at\nFashion advertising and try to find the\ntrends of faces modeling agencies will\nbe looking for in late\n2023-2024 we decide the best place to\nlook with sites like IMG models Ford\nmodels or Elite Model Management after\nall modeling management sites are just a\ncompilation of all of their active\nmodels on their books their catalog\nWorks Runway appearances and is more or\nless a Zeitgeist of what the industry\nlooks for from there we've tried to\nobserve the general direction that\nfashion aesthetic was moving towards but\none thing was quite obvious models are\nchosen generally because they are\nattractive we cover all of these\ncriteria in more detail on this channel\nbut what exactly makes a face attractive\nin other words before getting into the\nsmaller scale Trends we need to actually\nlook at what physical attractiveness is\nwhich is the focus of the channel\nfundamentals of an interactive face as\nestablished by researchers such as Dr 90\nthe top researcher in his field actually\naverageness coinophilia secondary sexual\ncharacteristics or sexual dimorphism\nproportion strong tender facial growth\nalso known as facial robusticity which\nis your features like high cheekbones\nrobust jawline prominent forward growth\nand and obviously symmetry which most\npeople already know but also considering\nother factors like youthfulness which is\na given because most models do tend to\nbe on the younger side but there are\nsome on the older as well this allows\nmodders to enter the fashion industry in\nthe first place and then the different\nsub-trans in features which we'll cover\nshortly are further selected for and\ncould be the difference between being\nselected into a mother agency a boutique\nagency a top agency perhaps a\npromotional agency there are many\ndifferent niches that are specifically\nlooking for certain features but there\nis a baseline that you do have to pass\nto be considered a model now when we\nmention this idea of a General Baseline\nthat's required to be considered into\nthe industry we do mean this in the most\ncasual of sense because there will still\nbe plus size models models with\ndisabilities models with acne or\nscarring but by and large that standards\nhave not really changed and what we mean\nby this you can look at agencies like\nanti-agency in the UK which Prides\nitself on being different to the\nmodeling standards that most people may\nconsider of being tall skinny white and\nblonde I suppose but you'll notice that\nthese models actually have more in\ncommon with regular other models than\nthey do with the regular person with\nstrong Jaws clear skin maybe unusual\nfeatures but nonetheless there is still\na level of similarity that is required\nto be in the industry and I made these\nexact comments you know as the founder\nof Curves 2 Vogue magazine last year if\nyou want to read my comments on Vogue\nthen there's an article but the industry\nis actually still very slow to change so\nthere is always going to be this level\nof physical attractiveness physical\ndentofacial definition or development\nthat is required to be in the modeling\nbracket so the point I'm trying to make\npersonally Off Script to you guys is\nthat most models do fit into a classical\nBeauty convention but the difference is\nin recent years we are moving away from\nhaving neurocentrismp part of that\nbeauty convention with a greater\ninclusivity of different racial features\nwhich is the main keep takeaway here but\nthere is still a level of classical\nBeauty convention which is dimorphism\nsymmetry it's clear skin and\nyouthfulness and so on and so forth\nthis discussion is very important\nbecause agency selections do determine\nwhat faces we look at virtually\neverywhere in the months and years to\ncome and in a trickle-down effect do\nalso affect other beauty standards in\ndifferent pop culture areas for instance\nif you look at the bleached brow that is\nmore of a high fashion look that's not\nreally common for the layperson but when\nyou do it it's considered to be or\nCouture because it's typically seen in\nmodeling Runway shows so it does have\nthis trickle-down effect of affecting\nmainstream culture so that's why\nmodeling fashion trends do matter to\nsome degree for the average person\nultimately the modeling industry is an\neconomy of Aesthetics the model that a\ncompany selects is a direct determinant\nof the financial success of their\nproduct and launch clothing companies\nlike Valentino have an immense\nunderstanding of their potential\ncustomer is going to be making a\nmicrosecond decision about their brand\nor product based on the appearance of\nthe model themselves I'll give you a\npersonal insight as a client now for a\nmodeling shoot where for the launch of\nskin strict which is my second company\nyou know me as the founder of Coos but\nalso I was a founder of skins trick we\nhad an aesthetic criteria for what type\nof models we would select the look we\nwere going for would not require models\nwith extreme facial characteristics like\nsay sonena which could be more of an\neditorial look you would see on Vogue\nbut instead the faces have to be\nsomewhat aloof somewhat cool looking and\nyet have averaged facial features that\ndon't detract away from the product\nbecause again this isn't a clothing\nproduct it's a skin care product you\nwant the focus to be on the bottle the\npackaging those kind of aspects really\nso the model is abstracted away from the\nphoto shoot and is not meant to be the\ndistraction from it if you look at the\nshots you'll see in some of them model\nis the focus and their personality does\nshow but more or less the focus is still\non the bottles so for a shoot like that\nyou probably wouldn't as a client choose\nfaces with extreme facial robusticity or\nextreme facial features that can\ndistract from the product itself so when\na client characterizes the look this is\nsomewhat instinctual as rosatal 2002\nStates even babies do have a preference\nfor looking at attractive faces so when\nyou think of it from that perspective\nwhich of the faces would you rather have\nrepresent your brand which one would you\nas a customer purchase something from\nand most people do choose the more\nattractive face but then within this\nrealm of attractive faces we choose\nfaces with extreme features with less\nextreme features more of a cute look but\nnonetheless all of these faces are\nattractive which is the point we're\ntrying to make\nthe most notable Trend that has already\nmade an impact in general discourse due\nto its understandable controversy is the\nResurgence of the heroine Chic look this\ntranslates as a push towards extreme\nfacial leanness or gaunteness and you\ncan think of Bella Hadid recently but\nshe wasn't the one that actually started\nthe trend to try and answer the question\nof why facial leanness why is this a\nsought after trade even for women our\nteam consulted some of the research by\nMichael Cunningham in 1986 entitled\nmeasuring the physical in physical\nattractiveness quasi-experiments on the\nsociobiology of female facial Beauty and\nin conducting his experiments and\ninterpreting the results Cunningham\nreviewed over 50 previous experiments\nand research papers on the subject his\nexperiments conducted tried to establish\na cause-effect relationship between\nspecific facial features and\nattractiveness scores especially for\nwomen as such the male participants\njudging nor the types of photos shown to\nthem were randomized two main\nexperiments relevant to us are one on\nneotenous features in women and another\non mature features or ontogenous\nfeatures in women we notice that\nneotenous beach is like large eyes small\nnoses large foreheads were quite linked\nto female attractiveness especially\ngreater eye width eye height and reduced\nnose size and this makes sense because\nthese are sexually dimorphic features\nmeaning that men on average have the\nexact opposite of these features to\nseparate men from the women other mature\nfeatures like the cheekbone width and\ncheek with two separate things as you\ncan see here were also linked to\nfeminine beauty though not as strongly\nas neotany this seems counter-intuitive\nbecause mature features are often the\nnegation or the opposite of any\nneotenous features or youthful features\nfor example large eyes are neotenous\nsmall eyes are mature but indeed\nCunningham's paper found a link there\nand also notes other research that found\na similar connection these maturity\nfeatures which might be considered\nmasculine were present in the most\nattractive eminent faces although\nneonate features we dominate and may\nelicit caretaking and affection the\nmature features could suggest status and\nencourage respect rather than\ncondescension because they do come with\na level of age and wisdom attract active\nwomen have been rated as high in\nleadership and dominance characteristics\ngoing to wisefield block in Ivers 1984\nthe combination of mature with neonate\nfeatures Also may signal that the woman\nis at an optimal age for sexual\nreproduction because it is just at the\ncusp of either one of those barriers but\nwhy specifically prominent cheekbones\nand lean or suddenly Hollow chicks well\nafter all nobility or maturity could be\nconveyed by the neonate feature of\nrounded cheeks in combination with other\nfeatures of small eyes and a large nose\nthus the perception of young adulthood\nstatus may not be the only factor in\ndetermining someone's facial Aesthetics\nthere is something especially attractive\nabout the mature feature of why\ncheekbones and defined chicks this is\nwhat is creating the hyper-attractive\nTop Model look in Western culture\nperhaps this is because Lane shakes are\nnot as sex exclusive as say a prominent\nbrow Ridge or a large nose which we\nalmost exclusively see on men to work\nbetter with their face shape than\ncompared to women just because of sexual\ndimorphism and biology either way we've\ngot the answer of why agencies might try\nto see these mature lean faces even in\nfeminine models Cunningham showed this\nfeature is correlated to being hired and\nit is also a more commanding feature\nwhich is especially relevant in the\nmodeling industry where you usually\ndisplay an intimidating Aura rather than\na queue and neotenous one commanding a\nRunway is also an integral part of being\na model in high fashion beauty is indeed\nnot some inexplicable quality in the eye\nof the beholder just because we can't\nexplain it doesn't mean somebody else\ncannot but then again the fashion\nindustry is not only about beautiful\nfaces and we certainly don't want to use\nmodels as the Hallmark for what makes a\nbeautiful face and they could perhaps\nhave different aesthetic qualities and\nyou might prefer just an average person\nover the model contemporary models are\nalready often distinct in their\nappearance due to their facial\nrobustness or definition but this trend\npushes it to the furthest degree which\nhas been exacerbated due to the\ndiscoverability effect where modeling\nagencies have an easier time than ever\nfinding robust or lean faces and the\nseeming ubiquity of plastic surgery in\nHollywood and other pop culture such as\nbuckle fat extraction cheek or chin\nimplants or filler which somewhat\nnormalizes these extremes is think about\nit 100 years ago we probably wouldn't\nhave seen this many attractive faces on\nour for you pages on Tech talk but now\nmore or less it is becoming more and\nmore common because of discoverability\nof algorithms pushing more attractive\nbases to the top because that's the one\nthat gets the most engagement what's\ninteresting about this is that the\nmodeling industry is simultaneously\nselecting more curved plus size models\nsuch as Paloma Elsa liskra Lawrence and\nAshley Graham but what is critical to\nrecognize here is that these Kirby\nmodels still have relatively strong\ndentofacial growth and leanness in spite\nof their body curvaceousness so\nessentially they still have the high\ncheekbones and strong jawline look and\nit's just their bodily frame that's\nlarger to suit their target market for\nclothing sales and simply put the faces\nwhat cells and the body shape is more or\nless variable so that regular consumers\ncan attain a greater consumer brand\nrelationship because not every person\nlooks like what you typically think of\nwhen you picture a high fashion the idea\nof the body does change but the face as\nagain I said in the Vogue article does\nnot change and has not changed for a\nlong time\nbesides the extreme facial leanness or\nthe heroin Shake Trend another Trend we\ncouldn't miss was the continued increase\nof androgyny selected by modeling\nagencies in the previous years we've\nwitnessed a more Universal acceptance of\nthe Pretty Boy aesthetic which is\ncharacterized with a less sexually\ndimorphic male bone structure which\nreads as a softer more feminized look on\nmen this follows in line with our\ndiscussion earlier to look androgynous\nyou're going to want to have a mixture\nof mature and neotenous features which\nis masculine and feminine features this\nis especially the case for features like\nthe eyes the jaw and nose where our eyes\nare drawn first think of your K-pop\nfigures or Timothy Charlemagne types\nthey still appear identifiably masculine\nbut to a lesser degree and with more\nfeminine features mixed into their\naesthetic than old-school fashion models\nlike David Gandy or John cordajarena and\nthis seems to be particularly engaging\namong younger demographics which is why\nfashion brands are choosing faces to\ncapture and reflect that in regards to\nfemale androgyny this time we're\nexpecting a continuation since the 80s\nfashion modeling of a leaning towards\nmale dimorphic jaw lines in feminine\nmodels which juxtaposes against their\nfeminine features again these are just\nTrends and you find that the majority of\nmodels do still have sexually dimorphic\njaw lines and eyes so for women this\nmeans less protrusive brow ridges and\nsoft jaw lines main takeaway is that the\nprevalence of androgynous models is\nincreasing and likely will increase into\n2024. if we take a brief look through\nsome of Bastion week's spring 2023 ready\nwear lines this is a huge emphasis on\nfacial and bodily androgyny for both men\nand women's looks this means that the\nfemale models will have\ncharacteristically masculinized bone\nstructure particularly around the jaw\ncomplex as well as more intimidating\neyebrows with a lower relative position\nnot usually found in your average woman\nCara Delevingne is an obvious example of\nthe aesthetic\nthe next feature or rather facial\ncharacteristic that modeling agencies\nhave been selecting for in higher\nnumbers than ever is racial or ethnic\nambiguity this one shouldn't come as a\nsurprise and it was impossible to miss\nwhen our team was looking at the data of\nagencies and Runway shows where\nsupermodels like China Shake is an\nexample of this particular quality being\nPakistani and Lithuanian gives shake her\nunique and distinct appearance this\nmulti-ethnic quality allows her to be\nmore approachable for a wider array of\nmarkets but also blur the lines of\ndifferent demographics So based on the\ndemands or the desires of the client\nChina has more of an ability to\ntransform or bend into a particular look\ndue to their ethnic ambiguity of their\nfeatures from a business perspective\nthat means she can now Target double the\namount of client bases than one who has\na very distinct ethnically known look in\nthe modeling world one must emphasize\nwhat makes them different from the crowd\nin order to be memorable unique defining\nfeatures or characteristics of what\nagencies look for and shyk Exhibits a\nlook perfect for modern day modeling\nwhether it's Runway or print the\nattention is on the model in fashion\nwhich means a unique ethnically\nambiguous look is definitely a part of\nwhat modeling agencies want for the face\nin 2023 and presumably into 2024\nwe'll know that there is a big\ndifference between an Instagram model\nand an actual sign model who walks\nhigh-end Couture a starting model should\ntake digitals with little to no maker\nthat's non-negotiable agencies want to\nwork with someone with naturally clear\nskin and they want to know where you\ntruly look like agencies will likely\nimmediately skip over any submitted\nphotos that have bull face of makeup and\nwe've asked agency owners this and\nthat's exactly well that's what they say\nso is acne really a disqualifier for\nbecoming a model well no but there is\ncertainly a preference or Trend towards\nclear skin because it gives a more\nseamless base to work with from both the\nmakeup artist the hairstylist all of the\npeople on set will have an easier job if\nthere is less to cover up there are\nhowever agencies who are looking for\nmodels with blemishes or even some level\nof acne to differentiate themselves\ncertain ads maybe for skincare or makeup\nwant to display what their products can\ndo and for example Kendall Jenner notes\nhow she struggled with her skin in a\nBerg beauty secrets video where Browns\nwould jump at the opportunity to work\nwith her and Market her skin glow up as\nattributed to their products in this\ncase having input Perfect Skin could be\nthe acid but it is not the general gist\nof what we're seeing\nso circling back to the original\nquestion how does this affect you as a\nconsumer of fashion brands or just as an\nobserver of the constantly shifting\nbeauty trends well obviously if you want\nto become a model these criterias are\ngoing to influence the things modeling\nagencies are looking for some of these\nTrends May alienate consumers who View\nHigh fashion as an enigma or something\nthey can't understand or don't want to\nunderstand high-end fashion brands like\nValentino again often prioritize the\ndesign and Aesthetics of a practicality\nwhen creating their clothes these Brands\ntend to create clothing that is more\nfocused on making a statement or\nconveying a particular artistic Vision\noften showcasing their creativity and\ncraftsmanship through Runway shows and\nCouture collections where the Garment\ncan be seen as works of art rather than\neveryday wear as such the model has to\nhave a face that is also considered this\nartistic work of art rather than an\neveryday average looking face and that's\nwhy there is also this selection for\nextreme facial features that being said\nmost high-end fashion brands do offer\nmore practical and wearable collections\nalongside their Couture lines and that\nis almost an entirely different\ndifferent brand of modeling more so\ncommercial modeling as opposed to\nhigh-end Couture modeling which has\ndifferent agencies and different people\nand their books for a different look\naltogether overall the faces on the\nrunway seem to be straying from normalcy\nwith the aesthetic of the faces almost\nparalleling the artist's vision for the\nclothing this may be off-putting to your\naverage person but I suppose that is the\nnature of polarizing Artistry still\nthere are plenty of conventionally\nattractive models even in the subset of\nhigh fashion and in fact they are\nprobably the majority however it is\ninteresting seeing where the fashion\nindustry is going and it's difficult to\npredict what the trend will be in five\nto ten years from now we'd like to hear\nyour thoughts though you think modeling\nagencies are looking for the right\nfeatures or should they be reverting\nafter the scouting criterias of say the\nearly 90s where those criterias were\nincredibly harsh and very concise in\nselecting for virtually the same look if\nwe look at 90 supermodels they all look\nlike the same person in different shades\nof skin color that being said if you do\nwant to learn about your own face from a\nvery research clinical perspective\nwritten by our doctor and dentists have\nthem perform an assessment on your looks\nthen you can head over to the cruise\nwebsite and order a report if this is\nsomething you're interested in in\nknowing how to improve the way that you\nlook step by step getting a second\nopinion before a surgery or any kind of\nbad complication or just you're curious\nkind of like a 23andMe but put your face\njust out of pure curiosity you

four\nyears we've taken a look at the age-old\nquestion of what makes a face beautiful\nthrough the lens of scientific\nliterature but we thought it was time to\nBranch out and hear from real people

a\nnew series where we conduct real\nexperiments to find out real findings\nShop features shop bold features\num so like sharp jawline like sharp eyes\nsharp nose or like someone with a really\nkind fit I think the main thing for me\nwould be jawline oh yeah a guy like a\nreally good jawline and full lips\neverything else\nyeah teeth lips\nthere's\nthe African face\nI think definitely like somebody who\ntakes care of themselves is tailored but\nwhen it comes to Features I think maybe\nlike a nice jawline eyes smile lips\nstuff like that for men I guess I I like\nwhen men Channel their masculinity when\nwhen their eyes are a bit more\nclosed I don't find very attractive men\nthat have very wide eyes\nwhile a woman sometimes it's the\nopposite so like this\nso why is that attractive well in short\nwomen tend to have eyes with their\nhigher fissure index due to more\nvertical palpable height than men which\nin simple speak just means that they\nhave larger rounder eyes according to\nvarious literature on the topic that\nwe'll show here this gives a more docile\neye shape where Jared Leto would be an\nexample as a man with this kind of\nfeature this is obviously quite\nfeminizing Isabella also prefers wider\neyes in women but not men because wider\nsay eyes are typically found in\nattractive feminine faces of almost\nevery ethnicity according to rietel\nwhere you can see that attractive women\nhighlighted in yellow of each ethnic\ngroup have eyes that are wider set\nrelative to their total facial width\nbeyond that lower positioned eyebrows\ncan also contribute to that masculine\nlook and researchers like 90 and Rhodes\nhave long established a strong link\nbetween sexual dimorphism and\nattractiveness there is a dyadic inverse\nrelationship between select attractive\nfeatures both men and women I like\nuniqueness like sometimes I like\nfreckles thin places like structured in\na guy I really do like dimples I think\nthey're just they're just beautiful\num a beard I really like beards as well\nI think that's kind of like\nwhat I like in a guy do I have the Gucci\nmassage combination the bird needs to\nlike connect with the jawline as well\nbut they also need to have like good\nteeth like a good smile yeah just like\num if you have good tea then you're\nautomatically at least\n[Music]\nthe first thing you see is a smile\nobviously and it shows like their\npersonality and their smile dimples are\nlike dimples smile because like if you\nhave like a crooked teeth like and\nyou're smiling it just doesn't look nice\nand if you have like really nice teeth I\ndon't know like man with nice teeth it's\njust I know it's nice a unique face I\nsuppose is the best way of looking at it\num like for example someone like\nAngelina Jolie has like you know such\ndistinct features um unique features you\nknow\num but yeah I I would say it's probably\nlips and eyes combination of lips and\neyes Hayden expressed a preference for\nfull lips because they are also a\nsexually dimorphic trait where having\nlips that occupy a larger proportion of\nthe vertical height of the lower third\nand a fuller in relation to your overall\nfacial width are attractive in women\naccording to carotel study they indicate\nhigher estrogen levels and also levels\nof youthfulness when Hayden says he\nprefers a unique base like Angelina's\nand presume he's talking about a face\nwith high overall facial averageness but\nalso select features like her lips for\nexample that do make her stand out from\nthe wrist so sure Angelina could still\nbe highly attracted with less full lips\nbut it does add to her look and that's\nwhy she is characterized as a lot of\npeople's types typically brown eyes\num\nnice lips and a good smell\nand obviously you know good skin as well\nyeah I mean I I like a nice face\nI don't like a face that's covered in\nhair I don't like hair on men much I\ndon't like beards or mustaches\num yeah again I would say the skin if\nhe's got good skin if he looks after his\nskin that means he looks after himself\nin his body so that means he's kind of\ngot it together\nI also look at the eyes yeah they've got\nto have nice eyes for me it's all about\nthe eyes\nI would say\num eyes are great great feature on\nsomebody whether or not\num they've got good eyes and good lashes\nI would say is something that's very\nimportant\num I like to find jaw lines on faces\nthey just look quite um\nI don't know just\nsmart I feel like smart people have\ndefined your lines\nthat depends on I don't know the mood\nthe what I'm feeling at that core in\ntime I think race has to do with it I\nlike different races but ultimately\nI would say more of a chiseled face like\nslight definition nothing too masculine\num I have this fixation with ethereal\nBeauty so I would say something someone\nthat has slightly more almond eyes I\nfind that quite attractive ears as well\nI quite like\nlarge ears for some reason on women I\nfind that quite attractive so what I\nkind of find attractive in faces is soft\nreally nice nose it's like really good\nskin obviously I don't really have that\ngreat skin but somebody doesn't perfect\nI like to find jawline but not too much\nlike just enough to notice that they\nhave a jawline\nuh I just think a kind of a slim and\nchiseled face look and nothing too much\nI think\nyou know\num in terms of both male and female\ngenerally speaking I think probably the\nthing that makes people kind of more\nattractive is just uh you know skin you\nknow the quality of their skin\num\nand how you know how clear it is and I\nthink just even proportions it is the\nkind of main thing I think people can\nhave different sizes or proportions\nacross their face but if they all work\ntogether then that's what works\nas long as they have a nice nice eyes\nand smile I think faces that have a\ndefined jawline and once again I don't\nknow how to describe this but like eyes\nthat go they're a little more tapered\ninside over here I think those eyes look\nreally really nice\nand I guess a nice nose like a small\npetite nose well we can assume ananya is\nreferring to is the medial candle angle\nor the sharpness of the inner eye Corner\nwe actually discovered research by\nwuetal that showed a more acute medial\ncandle angle was attractive in\nCaucasians and to a lesser degree in\nAfrican faces as well but that wasn't\nthe case for Korean faces because\nEastern beauty standards may prefer\nlarger eyes rather than the jaguar-like\neyes that were tell finds in the Western\nHemisphere yep um maybe a bigger nose\num\n[Music]\nlike good um cheekbones\nmaybe some facial hair\num\nI don't know thick eyebrows like\nmaybe light eyes or\nlike hazel eyes or blue eyes Rebecca\nactually preferred more sexually\ndimorphic traits in men think of a large\nnose thicker eyebrows as opposed to\nananya's preference of a petite nose man\nthis shows that there is no\none-size-fits all especially for the no\nshape\nI don't think I really have a type\nthat's necessarily I I like brown eyes\nquite a bit of the time\num I don't really necessarily think\nthere's any like proper features that I\nthat stand out to me that's like oh I\nlike it\num yeah probably just brown eyes again\nbig bright smile a little bit of facial\nhair\num I don't really have a type\num per se but I really like blue eyes\nand nice teeth\nI like darker features like tour dog\nhandsome so I like uh dark eyes like\nyeah a good jawline the dark hair like\nthe curly hair or the curtain bangs one\nof them yeah\nsoft features is something I would\ndefinitely find appealing and then I\nthink I'm really into South Asian\nuh people when women or men for that say\nI think I like men who are a little more\nCaucasian probably and also the beard\nand the jaw structure is something I\nlook at as well\nsome people do have preferences for\ncertain ethnicities when it comes to\nhaving a type this is also tied into the\nconcept of familiarity and pure exposure\nat least according to the cognitive\nliterature such as Roman natal study and\nDr Laszlo also notes that in his\nresearch inter-ethnic personal\nrelationships or long-term exposure does\ndecrease this amount of ethnic Prejudice\nso the more faces that you're exposed to\nthe better you're going to be at judging\nfaces of other people results of his\nmulti-level models suggest that mixed\ngroups are not sufficient but actual\nestablished personal contacts are\nnecessary to decrease same ethnicity\npreferences in dating our friend groups\npeople that we grow up around are friend\ngroups from adolescence and childhood\nvery distinctly affect our type and\ncharacterization of who we're attracted\nto when we're older and this is why\nrepresentation is often fought for in\nthe media because it really does have an\nimpact and it's not hardwired or\nbiologically ingrained that we prefer\npeople of a certain skin color or racial\nfeature it's more or less just popular\nculture I like a face that is\ninteresting features I think usually\nso not necessarily features that are\nstereotypically super attractive but but\nthings that make her a bit unique or\ndifferent I think if a girl's got really\nstrong eyebrows or something I think\nthat really stands out a lot or\nor really yeah prominent cheekbones and\nstuff as well just just some striking\nfeatures I think yeah\nsomething\num more acute than too masculine I like\nthe high cheekbones if they're available\nuh\nis my favorite thing in the world pretty\nmuch it's quite hot actually because I\nfor my preference I really like someone\nwho fit\nso it regardless I'm regardless if that\nperson have around facial shape but if\nthat person is fit so it doesn't matter\nit looks attractive to me I think ones\nthat\nfor guys usually like quite\nhigh cheekbones what sort of people\nwould probably term as like a classical\nBeauty with it being sort of more of a\nTimeless look rather than like two I\ndon't know modern looking\nindeed most of us would probably agree\nwith Emily's point about modern faces\nand with that being said we certainly\nenjoyed hearing the perspective of all\nof these people preferences for\nUniversal beauty standards and something\nwe've covered Ad nauseam on this channel\nwill definitely Prevail it and it goes\nback to the idea that there are\nattractive people from all Races\nreligions that creates ethnicities and\ngeographies of the world but they do\nhave elements in common that make them\nattractive that is the universal Beauty\nstandard that most people talk about and\nthis is a biological standard that's\ningrained into all of us through\nselecting healthy Partners the concept\nof averageness was even presented when\nterms like not too much or not too\ndefined were mentioned by Olivia and\nSamuel James however looking at the\nresults more closely there are still a\nlot of people who expressed a type\nthat's diametrically opposed to another\nperson's characterization for example\nand earnier preferred a defined jawline\nwhile asrita preferred softer features\nbeyond that there are also subtle\npreferential learnings towards less\nimportant features like the eye color or\nethnicity freckles and so on but the\nmost important features do seem to\nrevolve around the facial structure so\nwe hope you enjoyed learning and hearing\nfrom these people and we are grateful\nfor their time we'd like to hear your\nthoughts in the comments below and did\nany of their types resonate with you and\nif you'd like to get your face assessed\nin a way that's much more rigorous and\nbroken down into step-by-step objective\nimprovements that you can do to

the\nidea that people are favored just\nbecause they're\nattractive in fact there is a term that\ndescribes this phenomenon very well lism\nor appearance-based discrimination is a\nmatter that's actually well documented\nin economic psychological and\nsociological research papers similar to\nracism sexism or agism lookism is\nconsidered a form of discrimination\nbased on looks as described by warhost\nand colleagues this is the first type of\npretty privilege we're going to talk\nabout and it forms an umbrella that\nencompasses all of the other following\ntypes Leal goes so far as to link\nincreased repeated an incident that\nforms from this type of discrimination\nwith higher odds of poor self-reported\nhealth with women especially actually\nreporting more repeated experiences of\nappearance-based discrimination\nespecially in early childhood this form\nof discrimination can really impinge on\none's social life and development just\nlike any other form but with a more\nsignificant effect for social ability\ntoday we're going to learn about what is\ncommonly known as pretty privilege this\nrefers to a social Advantage like having\na high educational or socioeconomic\nstatus that stems from being attractive\nin this video we're going to explore the\nsix types of pretty privileges as\ndefined in the psychology papers and\nwe're going to also look at its causes\nand consequences in later\ndevelopment we tend to believe that\nattractive individuals possess desirable\nsocial traits conversely there is an\nunconscious negative view of\nunattractive individuals for example we\noften assume that they are more likely\nto commit Norm violations or engage in\nsocially unacceptable undesirable\nbehaviors in Psychology this is known as\nthe halo effect the halo effect is a\ncognitive bias meaning it's something\nthat influences the way we look at the\nworld on the outside and it's often\nsomething that we're not even aware of\ndoing where people generally form\nopinions about something or someone\nbased on their positive or negative\npredispositions for instance you might\nassume that a modern or attractive car\nis safer to drive than an older or\nunattractive one although the data may\nnot back that up when it comes to people\nforming an accurate impression of an\nindividual requires considering the\ndynamic interactions of many various\ntraits this means that different\ncharacteristics influence each other to\ncreate a final impression of a person\nthe halo effect leads to the formation\nof a positive general impression based\non limited information from isolated\nphysical traits typically these are\nrevolved around attractiveness since\nthat's what we can first judge about a\nperson when we see them initially in\nother words certain traits act as a Halo\ncasting a positive light on other\ncompletely unrelated attributes for\ninstance being physically attractive\nwhich is the first thing you see about a\nperson may also cast a positive light on\nyour impression of how intelligent they\nare or how warm they are how charismatic\nthey are how capable they are completely\nunrelated traits the opposite of this\nphenomenon has been referred to as the\ndevil effect by Gibson and colleagues\nand in one such podcast episode we\nactually went into depth talking about\nsomething called the double devil effect\nwhere being physically unattractive has\na double negative effect rather than\nbeing physically attractive which has a\nsingle positive effect in simple speak\nit's worse being physically less\nattractive than the benefits of being\nphysically more attractive where\ngenerally this means we judge less\nattractive individuals as less competent\nor less socially skilled because this is\nthe reverse of the halo effect this is\nparticularly important because the\noverall evaluation of someone as good or\nbad influences our future judgments of\nthat person therefore the halo effect\nlies at the core of pre privilege being\nconsidered attractive or unattractive by\nSociety standards influences most\naspects of Our Lives at least to some\nextent beauty also affects quality of\nlife for instance attractive individuals\ntend to enjoy a higher quality of life\nwhich is repeatedly reported in\nscientific papers but also this one's\npretty much Common Sense this includes\nearning higher salaries experiencing\nmore fulfilling relationships receiving\nbetter treatment from others and having\nan overall sense of well-being the most\nnotable social consequence of being\nattractive is having higher self-esteem\nwhich in turn leads to positive outcomes\nin various aspects of Life a according\nto Lian colleagues self-esteem is\ninfluenced by how we perceive our value\nto others this means that our\nself-esteem is tied to how others view\nUS evaluate and subsequently interact\nwith us which in turn forms if we have\nhigh or low self-esteem in other words\nour appearance determines how Society\ntreats us which in turn shapes our\nself-image as a result it's easy to\nunderstand how attractive individuals\ntend to have higher self-esteem and as a\nresult they are treated better they see\nthemselves being treated better and so\nthey view themselves as being better on\nthe other hand individuals who are\nperceived as less attractive often face\nrejection in various areas of life but\nseemingly inexplicable reasons while it\nis evident that physical appearances\nplays a role in romantic rejections and\nromantic rejections has a significant\nimpact on self-esteem that is not the\nonly aspect for how this negatively\nimpacts less attractive individuals they\nalso experience rejection in other forms\nsuch as platonic friendships workplace\nrelations or just being considered less\ncapable by teachers as is the an\nexample beauty is also very highly\nvalued in the labor market primarily for\nthe two reasons we mentioned above there\nare significant benefits to being\nphysically attractive and economists\ntheorize this Effect called the beauty\npremium where basically Brands\ncolleagues workers and companies want to\ncapitalize on your beauty by essentially\nturning looks into money attractive\nindividuals earn higher salaries\ncompared to those considered less\nattractive in one such groundbreaking\nstudy on the topic HR Mission colleagues\ndemonstrated an average wage penalty of\nup to 10% for individuals perceived as\nplain or unattractive and an average\npremium of up to 10% for those deemed\nvery attractive the challenge is that\nunlike other forms of discrimination\nluism is actually not considered legal\ndoes the beauty premium apply\nuniversally or is a bias then you might\nask well for instance one might expect\nthat being attractive as a salesperson\nor waitress could provide significant\nbenefits and discriminating based on\nthat would not be reasonable de euga and\ncolleagues found that the beauty premium\ncan indeed be task dependent in a\nbargaining task where individuals acted\nas sellers of electronic equipment\nattractiveness strongly influenced the\noutcomes of the sale in other words\nattractive sellers received higher wages\ncompared to unattractive sellers however\nthey did not observe a beauty premium in\ntasks that were more intellectually\noriented such as say data entry or being\na programmer nevertheless other research\nhas shown that the beauty premium\nextended task both related and related\nto appearances such as credit markets\nprofessional sports college classrooms\nand even elections pretty obvious that\none thus the effect persists even in\nsituations where Beauty does not appear\nto play an obvious role where we get\ninto some examples of that in our video\nwhy do athletes have more attractive\nfaces or do you get hired more because\nof your physical looks the beauty\npremium is primarily a result of the\nhalo effect employers tend to assume\nthat attractiveness is indicative of\nskill relative to the job performance\nwhich leads to them being being willing\nto pay more for attractive individuals\nbut it is also true that attractive\nindividuals do have the ability to sell\nmore simply because of how humans have\ncognitive biases towards other\nattractive\nindividuals one very understated\nadvantage of being physically attractive\nis the ability to get away with Norm\nviolations much more easily Norm\nviolations can range from minor\ninfractions such as cutting the line to\nmore severe violations of the law where\nsay in a two-way C crash the person who\nis at fault may just depend on who is\nphysically more attractive if the answer\nisn't obvious the greater the deviation\nfrom the norm the more Society tends to\ndislike the individual involved when\nencountering someone engaging in\nsuspicious Behavior quick and critical\ndecisions need to be made such as\nwhether to approach the individual or\nalert the authorities attractiveness\nplays a crucial role in those kind of\nscenarios but as we've seen it can also\nlead to inaccurate judgments and\npredisposed decisions there are three\ndimensions in which attra acess\ninfluences this type of dynamic the\nlikelihood of committing a norm\nviolation the perception of\nintentionality and the extent of social\npunishment attractive individuals are\nviewed as more likely to conform to\nsocietal Norms on the other hand\nindividuals perceived as less attractive\nare seen as more inclined to commit Norm\nviolations this perception arises\nbecause attractive individuals are\nexpected to behave predictably and to be\nwell socially adjusted which makes sense\nbecause attractive individuals are\ntreated better so so they have no reason\nto rebel against the society that treats\nthem better in contrast less attractive\nindividuals are regarded as\nunpredictable due to potential\nmistreatment or resentment towards\nSociety attractive individuals are also\nperceived as more likely to commit Norm\nviolations involving positive behaviors\nthis means that their intentions often\nmitigate the perception of their\nwrongdoing for example if someone who is\nattractive steals food from a store we\nmay justify that act as being driven by\nhunger or trying to feed a family of\nfive\nhowever if the person is less attractive\nwe are more inclined to perceive it as\nrobbery another example is the act of\nforgetting to flush the toilet for an\nattractive individual it may be seen as\na simple mistake however when it\ninvolves a less attractive person it can\nbe viewed as a sign of unhygienic\nbehavior these examples serve to\nillustrate the general idea that\nregarding attractive individuals we tend\nto excuse Norm violations as exceptions\nrather than indicative of their typical\nBehavior finally being attractive\nprovides individuals with a certain\ntolerance when it comes to violating\nsocial norms resulting in fewer\npotential consequences compared to their\nless attractive counterparts for\ninstance research has shown that\nattractive individuals often receive\nless severe punishment in legal trials\nthe perception of a norm violation is\neither creepy or innocent is influenced\nby the Halo or the devil effect we tend\nto attribute positive intentions to\nattractive individuals and negative\nintentions to less attractive\nindividuals as a result attractive\nindividuals face fewer consequences for\nfor both minor and severe Norm\nviolations which in turn contributes to\na better quality of life for them\noverall generational effects are maing\ndecisions that we make that affect the\nreproductive success of our offsprings\nlater on these are often influenced by\nphysical attractiveness the existence of\nthese ideas in humans is debated but\nworth exploring nonetheless according to\nevolutionary biology a female's ideal\nmate is one with good genes which in\nturn produces males with the best chance\nof reproductive success we see this in\nmost organisms and there is good theory\nthat this also applies to humans too\ntherefore other benefits that the father\ncan offer are less relevant including\nfor example his capacity as a parental\ncaregiver in comparison to his genetic\nstrength therefore what matters most is\nthe future success of her sons rather\nthan the success of her daughters which\nin turn will have somebody quoting them\nno matter how they look like more or\nless this is called a sexy sun\nhypothesis which is pretty interesting\nand we have covered this two other times\nthis was proposed by Patrick J\nWeatherhead and rayy J Robertson of\nQueens University in\nKingston and therefore to guarantee that\nsuccess they need to trade off for\nhighly masculine fathers which are often\npoor longterm Partners this in turn\nproduces very attractive Sons which in\nturn can chase after a number of women\nand be successful whereas daughters in\ngeneral would be chased after by other\nmen so it doesn't really matter matter\nin prioritizing the looks of the\ndaughter as opposed to prioritizing the\nlooks of the potential son this is just\none of the many evolutionary theories\nwe've covered on the podcast and on our\nchannel in the past with Simon groom a\nbiologist and we have seen many of these\nfall more or less in Trend therefore we\ndo see a tendency for resource and all\nlooks poor men to go invisible off the\nsexual Market more particularly men\nwithout these highly masculine or\ndimorphic features who find it tougher\nand tougher to compete as there is an\ninflation of physical looks this is the\nlast form of pretty privilege one where\nbeing an attractive person man or women\nyou will possess a likely higher\nreproductive benefit that ripples\nthrough\ngenerations with that being said this is\nnot entirely all doom and gloom there is\nstill multifaceted aspects to explore\nsuch as wealth and Status which do have\nconfounding effects for both men and\nwomen and can increase or decrease\ndesirability but there are also other\nways that we have to look at that one\ncan make themselves more desirable\nwithout resorting to just physical\nattractiveness with that being said if\nyou'd like to learn more about your own\nphysical attractiveness if that's a\ncuriosity of yours if you'd like

"content": "try to think of a classically handsome\nface and who comes to mind or just ask\nanyone who comes to mind when they think\nof a handsome man Brad Pitt would\nprobably top that list at least in the\n90s and early 2000s and even perhaps\nstill today but he undoubtedly has the\nlooks as well I mean he is just one of\nthose people that can pull off any\nhairstyle and hair color and just about\nany piece of clothing but most people\nhave to consciously select hairstyles\ncolors that work best for their face but\nnot Brad so what makes his face so\nconventionally attractive and attention\ngrabbing in today's video we're going to\nbreak down the science behind Brad\nPitt's facial attractiveness from things\nas simple as his hairstyle to more\ncomplex topics like his facial bone\nstructure facial dimorphism proportion\nand symmetry Brad is attractive for the\nsame reason that any beautiful person is\nattractive he has a face with high\naverageness high sexual dimorphism high\nlevels of symmetry and harmonious\nproportions it doesn't break the mold of\nconventionally attractive features looks\nfor in a face as defined by Gillian\nRhodes study on evolutionary activeness\nthough there are other factors like\ncultural influences these four are the\nmain things researchers agree that\ncomprise any attractive face we're going\nto mainly focus on two of those walls so\nthe video doesn't drag on averageness\nand proportion keep in mind that there\nis often an overlap between the other\ncategories as well as for symmetry well\nanyone with a pair of eyes can see that\nBrad has an exceptionally symmetrical\nface so we're not going to focus on that\nbut that doesn't explain why Brad Pitt\nis attractive we can mainly attribute\nBrad Pitt's Beauty to his pleasantly\naverage facial proportions after\nevaluating the bigger concepts of\nsymmetry facial proportion and\ndimorphism we can still look at some of\nthe smaller aspects of facial Beauty\nsuch as hair and youthfulness so let's\ndelve right into the specifics of why\nBrad Pitt is classically attractive by\nWestern beauty standards one of the\nfirst things that comes to mind when you\nthink of Brad Pitt is his jawline it's\nvery characteristic and his facial\nstructure is very robust we can tangibly\nfind out why his facial structure is so\nattractive through facial proportions\nand landmarks that cosmetic surgeons and\northodontists have been using for\ncenturies to help their patients get a\nbetter looking face to measure the\nharmony of Brad Pitt's bone structure we\nwant to First Look at a side profile\nwhich is what an orthodontist would\ntypically do while at first glance he\ndoesn't seem to have the most\nmodel-esque side profile it actually\nfits most though not all of the\nstandards of conventional facial\nattractiveness that are defined for\nfacial development it seems to have a\nnormal alignment of the jaw so no\nnotable overbites or underbites and that\nPleasant dentofacial structure is\nusually one step for an overall\nattractive facial development we could\ngo into every single one of these\nassessments used by orthodontist laid\nout by fort sotol in their study but for\nsimplicity's sake let's just get the\noverarching idea out of the way the\ngeneral relationship of Brad Pitt's Nose\nLips brow region and jaw is favorable\nand attractive all within adequate\nforward projection neither one is too\nprotruding nor is it too large small or\nmisshapen this is where all the\ncephalometric meaning measurements of\nthe head the Angles and proportions come\ninto play and if you're curious on\nscreen are some of the noteworthy ones\nbeing highlighted and shown changing any\nof these features begins to\ndis-harmonize the face and it would show\nfrom the front view as well as you can\nsee making his jaw more or less\nprominent or his nose or even his brow\nRidge begins to throw off the balance\nthat makes an attractive face and simply\nput he looks less harmonious if you want\nto use that word actually Harmony can\nmean proportional and forming a pleasing\nface as a whole there's a bit of a\ndifficult word to Define you can use\nthese terms interchangeably to describe\nBrad's face it has a balanced harmonious\nand pleasant facial structure the last\npoint about his bone structure that we\nshouldn't Overlook is that he also has\nthose coveted high cheekbones that are\nvery preferential by Western beauty\nstandards foreign\nstructure itself Brad's face just looks\nlike a face that chews a lot what does\nthat mean well he exercises his jaw\nmuscles just like any other muscles in\nthe body and he has very robust facial\nWhip and by that we mean there are 15\nminute compilations of Brad just eating\nin his film roles it seems that he's\nfound a way to mix his jaw exercises\nwith his work and the muscle responsible\nfor creating that flared wide jaw is the\nmass of the muscle you've probably seen\ntons of YouTube videos from channels\nlike Brett Maverick that recommend\nchewing more to grow this muscle and get\na wider jaw for men however there is a\nthreshold where this muscle can become\ntoo developed leading to an overly boxy\nappearance of the jaw particularly in\nwomen massive reduction surgery or Botox\nis actually used to make the jaw\nharmonize better with the facial\nstructure we can see how altering Brads\nby gonial with or the jewel with changes\nhis look completely taken to either\nextreme of too wide or too narrow it\nbegins to negatively impact his\nattractiveness doing a toll shows this\nphenomenon quite well and in this figure\nyou can see which Jewel width was the\nmost attractive and which was the least\nit seems that the middle ground looks\nthe most harmonious\nthe thing to note is that the images\nwhile rated by both men and women appear\nto look more female the paper notes how\nactors like age sex and culture can\ninfluence preferences for specific\nfacial features and before faces with\nmore masculine features being presented\na wider jaw would be preferred however\nconceptually it is fair to say that this\nideal jaw width would still be near the\nmiddle ground as with most human facial\nfeatures and in other words Brad's jaw\nhas high quiniphilia or aboriginous it's\nnot too wide but it also is wide enough\nto look masculine and Powerful a very\nhealthy middle ground this is where\nsexual dimorphism the third Factor so\ncomes in but let's try to stay focused\non Brad's facial averageness or the\nnormalcy of his face remember the\naverageness represents a range of values\nthat can look equally beautiful it is\nnot about achieving one specific\nproportion where some people claim a\none-to-one ratio of the jaw width to\ncheekbone looks best but rather as long\nas your jaw is not too narrow or wide\nand it fits within a range of values\nrather than one specific value it will\nlook best for your specific facial\nfeatures narrowing Brad's Jewel in\nPhotoshop seems to be less impactful to\nhis facial attractiveness than making it\nlook excessively wider and should\nbelieve this is because he already has a\nvery wide jaw to begin with even making\nit slightly wider makes his face look\ntoo full and Bloated which of these\nimages look more attractive to you in\nthe original Brad's jewel is about 91 of\nhis buy zygomatic width or the cheekbone\nwidth and in the after his jaw is\nslightly less at 88 the difference is\nalmost negligible in terms of facial\nattractiveness because he still has that\naverage in a Zone where he falls within\nthe range of normal values one such\npaper by rayneck and veretti discusses\nclinical soft tissue assessments of\nfacial Aesthetics they note that the\njewel width should be 70 of the\ncheekbone width Dr 90 laid out a similar\nstandard in his study as well though\nthis simply does not play out in reality\nyou can see that making Brad's jawline\nthat wide does not look as attractive\nnor does it in women either it would be\ninteresting to examine the pool of\nresearch behind how they established the\nideal but that is beyond what we're\ngoing to be talking about in this video\nthe paper does know that the height of\nthe face divided by the width should be\nabout 1.35 for a male and this does seem\nto align more with the concept of\naverageness where Brad's face has\nprecisely that ratio and his face does\nnot appear too long or Too Short\naltering his facial height or width\nbegins to stray from the middle ground\nand makes him less attractive in other\nwords if his face becomes longer the\nratio will start to skew upwards of 1.4\nif his face becomes more compact the\nratio will skew lower than 1.3 and you\ncan see how Brad's face begins to look\nless harmonious or mathematically\naverage on either end of the spectrum\nmoving on to the eyes Brad Pitt has the\nPerma squinty modelesque look that's the\nactual scientific term don't quote me on\nthat is small almond-shaped eyes\ncertainly contribute to the appearance\nand while larger shaped eyes appear to\nbe more attractive in women that is not\nthe case in men because they tend to\nmake a face look submissive at least\naccording to multiple papers by Keating\nBrad's smaller eyes make him look more\ndominant and attractive but at the same\ntime they are not overly small where\nthey're disharmonized with this facial\nstructure in general Brad looks more\nlike the mature face on the right of\nthis figure with a more angular jaw and\nsmaller eyes if we were to make his eyes\nlarger in Photoshop this would impact\nhow dominant and attractive he appears\nso what about the shape and angle of the\neyes surely that also adds to its\nattractiveness and indeed it does Brad\nseems a bit most conventional Caucasian\nstandards of attractiveness for the eyes\nlaid out by Wu at all without getting\ntoo technical we'll look at the lateral\ncounter tilt and the medial cantal angle\ntwo of those measurements abbreviated as\nLCT and MC\nif you're confused these images will\nshow you what we're looking at and in\nthat paper the attractive Caucasian\nphase add more upturned eyes with a tilt\nof around 7 degrees as opposed to the\naverage attractive Caucasian with 4\ndegrees Brad is right in the middle and\nthe angle made by the inner eye corner\nor the MCA is about 31 degrees it seems\nlike the more attractive faces had more\nacute angles like Brad Pitt or simply\nput sharper in eye Corners interesting\nand to make this even clearer if we play\naround with these parameters we have a\nhit to its overall attractiveness we can\nchange the tilt of his eyes in Photoshop\nto be either more upturned and cat-like\nor droopy and tired looking seems to\nlook best around its normal eye tilt\nwhich aligns with the research that we\njust spoke about we can also make his\ninner eye Corner more or less sharp\nwhich also affects his look alright so\nlet's round out the discussion by\ntalking about skin hair and youthfulness\nmost people acknowledge that being\nyouthful is super important when it\ncomes to looking attractive that is\nsimply the way it is but depending on\nthe research you're looking at Peak\nfertility for men and women is generally\nat or below 30 years old and it's not\nsurprising that this is around when we\ntend to look our most attractive however\nBrad has not really suffered from the\ndeleterious effects of Aging yes he is\narguably less attractive at 59 but he\nstill retains the backbone of his facial\nattractiveness from the things we just\ncovered like proportion and sexual\ndimorphism the reason for this is\nbecause his attractiveness comes from\nthe bone structure which it doesn't age\nas much I mean bone is solid doesn't sag\nlike soft tissue and facial fat does and\nso having strong bone structure is a key\nto aging gracefully and having the same\nface that you had in your 20s just a bit\nmore wrinkly and aged losing the\nyouthful features of vibrant healthy\nhair and homogeneous lustrous skin is an\nunderlying rule of nature that everyone\nhas to go through however Brad's\nFoundation of attractiveness through his\nbone structure makes him retain his\nBeauty almost effortlessly he is indeed\naging like everyone else but he looked\nbetter in his 20s and 30s than he will\nat 65. however the thing that made Brad\nPitt Stand Out attractive in the first\nplace was not his youthfulness it was\nevery other facial feature that we've\ntouched on from dimorphism proportion\nand obviously the sharpness of his\nfeatures an individual that does not\nhave the same robust bone structure or\nthe sexual dimorphism and Harmony has to\nrely on their youth as the focal point\nof their beauty this is crucial why\nfaces like Mass Mickelson and Brad Pitt\nage so well for Brad it's just a bonus\nat the same time let's not detract from\nhow well he has maintained at the\nyouthfulness of his skin and hair which\nis obviously the celebrity money coming\nin but that likely has to do with the\ncombination of genetics healthy diet and\nbeing physically fit as well and other\npotential regiments like expensive skin\ncare and Botox one of the key reasons\nwhy Brad Pitt can pull off any hairstyle\nis because of his facial proportions and\nmasculinity not his use even approaching\n60 he pulls off different looks with\nease and we talked about his face shape\nnot being too long or short and thus he\ndoesn't have to Spore any specific\nhairstyle to give the illusion of a\nbetter facial shape and so with that we\npretty much cover what makes Brad Pitt\nattractive comment on any of the faces\nyou would like to see analyzed in this\nseries as we're going to be doing more\ncelebrity analysis videos in the coming\nmonths if you'd like to get your face\nassessed within analysis or an\nassessment just like we broke it down\nhere by much more depth and detail

have on our\nown perceptions of attractiveness in\ntoday's video we're going to explore the\ndifferent effects that stunning\ncelebrities have on our self-esteem and\nhow we perceive and evaluate individuals\nin our everyday lives there is indeed an\ninflation of looks imagine yourself\nwatching a show or looking at a recent\nedition of Vogue that features only\nexceptionally attractive men and women\npurely afterwards you're introduced to a\nnew neighbor or a colleague who happens\nto be of let's say average physical\nattractiveness you think your previous\nexperience would affect your judgment of\nthis person's attractiveness as we spend\nmore time being exposed to these images\nour own perceptions of attractiveness\nbecome influenced even though there has\nbeen a noticeable Trend towards\ndiversity in recent years advertisements\npopular movies and novels continue to\nshow characters with above average\nlevels of physical attractiveness\nbecause that is what sells this\ndiversity is still not really diversity\nin physical beauty is just diversity by\nskin color physical features perhaps\nrace or gender but not actually by\nattractiveness in addition since in\nCouture fashion we still see these\ncharacters conform to certain standards\nof beauty it is still possible that\ncultural differences are obscured in\nfavor of Western ideals this implies\nthat we become adapted to high levels of\nattractiveness by the Western standards\nwhich can result in skewed lower\nassessment of the beauty average of\nregular individuals in the real world to\nthe extent that even attractive\nindividuals may be perceived as not so\nattractive anymore because we've just\nseen some extreme levels of physical\nBeauty and unsurprisingly there is a lot\nof psychological research on This\nresearch by Kendrick and colleagues has\nshown that there is a phenomenon known\nas a contrast effect when it comes to\nJudgment of physical attractiveness\naccording to their findings our initial\nimpressions of a potential dating\npartner can be negatively influenced if\nwe've been recently exposed to posters\nmagazine televisions movies what have\nyou featuring highly attractive\nindividuals as a result our assessment\nof their attractiveness and their\ndesirability as a potential dating\npartner becomes lower than what they\nwould receive otherwise and if you\nconsider the opposite say you're\ndeployed on a military base somewhere\nout in a remote place with all men or\nall women and you see no members of the\nopposite sex or the same sex depending\non your preference you would definitely\nget that Army goggles as they call it\nwhere you would see those members that\nyou're attracted to as more attractive\nthan they would on the outside based on\nThis research if you have been\npreviously exposed to an overwhelming\nnumber of Attractive people your brain\nmay experience a reward overload as a\nresult when you encounter a person of\naverage attractiveness you are less\nlikely to experience rewards because of\nthe adaptation to the high standards\nyour dopamine senses quite literally\nstart to burn out this can lead to a\nreduction in your visual attention\ntowards the new person displaying less\nfriendliness and overall being more\naloof or less interested in them and\nmoreover you're also going to feel less\ninclined to seek future interactions\nwith them because you're not as\nromantically interested interestingly\nthese effects are not only immediate but\nalso chronic meaning that individuals\nwho are frequently exposed to mass media\nperception of gorgeous celebrities or\njust gorgeous people in general which is\nrealistically all of us we all tend to\ndevelop inflated standards of physical\nattractiveness for individuals who are\nless physically attractive this can lead\nto the adoption of unrealistically high\nstandards and subsequent dissatisfaction\nwith the individuals who are actually\navailable to them so in other words\nbeing delusional about where you stand\nin the dating market and you'd ask does\nthis phenomenon work in the opposite\ndirection well certainly indeed exposure\nto individuals were less physically\nattractive can enhance the perception of\nan average individual's attractiveness\nluckily according to cognitive\npsychology there may also be a flip side\nto these phenomenas where if media\nrepresentations are perceived as\nbelonging to a different category or a\nrealm compared to real life individuals\nthe beauty might be discounted and\nfailed to influence judgments of\nnon-media individuals so for example\nwhen you see attractive hominids they're\nnot really humans in avatar The\npandorans well you're not going to\nreally count their beauty standards as\ninfluencing your own that makes sense\nand other words extremely attractive\ncelebrities may be seen as unattainable\nso for instance looking at somebody like\nMadison Beer who may or may not have had\nsome work done you would consider that\noh that's just a celebrity effect that's\nnot a realistic Beauty standard and\ntherefore their beauty can be excluded\nfrom your assessment of real world\nattractiveness are these effects due to\nthe fact that attractive individuals are\nmore memorable you may ask and therefore\nthey remain in our minds for longer are\nthey considered more unique well\ninterestingly Attractive people are more\nlikable but harder to distinguish from\neach other because they share greater\nfacial morphological similarities in\nother words they're all attractive to\nthe same type of person in a different\nfont and this is according to one such\nstudy by light and colleagues among\nother papers his finding is part of a\nbroader phenomenon where category\nmembers who bear more resemblance to\neach other are perceived as more\nordinary or typical which is quite\ncontradictory when you think about it\nthat the most attractive people actually\ntend to look more ordinary when compared\nto other attractive people because they\nwill have the same set of features the\nsame set of shapes say amount of\nsymmetry and high end clear skin and all\nof those markers that make somebody\nperhaps physically attractive the\nauthors of the study discovered a strong\ncorrelation between judgments of\nattractiveness and typicality which\nrefers to being ordinary this\ncontradicts the idea that highly\nattractive faces are quote unquote\nunique and is connected to a concept we\nhave explored in many of our videos\ncalled coinophilia or in plain English\naverageness or typical faces represent\nthe average features of the population\nand are consequently perceived as more\nattractive therefore more likable faces\nare typically more average and share\ngreater similarities with each other\nwhich makes them less unique and\ntherefore less memorable of course other\nresearch has also highlighted the fact\nthat highly attractive faces tend to\nhave at least one exceptional or\nnon-average feature but their face as a\nwhole is usually quite high in normalcy\nor averageness when we're considering\nproportions clear skin the lack of\ntumors or malformations the facial\ndevelopment so on and so forth so in\nsummary that is not the answer that more\nattractive faces are actually harder to\nremember unusual faces which which may\nbe less attractive due to the lack of\naverageness or being less symmetric more\nmemorable contradictorially this is why\na lot of fashion models may not\nnecessarily possess that Prince Charming\ntype of handsome with their harmonious\ntype of features but rather a more\nmemorable standout look with extreme\nlevels of dimorphism and extreme feature\nextreme proportions again a common\nexample would be somebody like zenena\nwho has a very wide nasal Bridge which\nalso makes her face very striking this\nalso means models don't have quote\nunquote to be the most spatially\nattractive type of people not all the\neffects of being bombarded with images\nof highly attractive people in the media\nare negative there is a possibility that\nconsumers can respond to these models by\nexcelling in various tasks idealized\nmodels can serve as motivation for\nimproved performance in areas Beyond\njust attractiveness in other words real\nworld individuals seek to differentiate\nthemselves from idealized celebrities by\nenhancing aspects such as their decision\nmaking skills in everyday life according\nto Social Psychology upward comparisons\ncan act as a source of inspiration and\nstimulates self-enhancement I know\npersonally when I see a handsome male\nmodel it encourages me to go to the gym\nand not miss a day a study conducted by\nSobel and colleagues found that if they\nexposure to idealized advertising models\nleads to improved decision-making tasks\ndriven by motivational processes in\nother words there is an unconscious\ndesire to

attractiveness as\na result they may compensate by exerting\ngreater effort to achieve other goals in\ntheir other aspects of life in other\nwords individuals who feel dissatisfied\nwith their status in one area can\nregulate their negative feelings by\nusing it to fuel their performance in\nother areas these effects are influenced\nby the self-discrepancies that arise\nfrom comparing oneself to

"assistant", "content": "why would you rate yourself on a scale\nof 1 to 10 10 but I'm also an\ninternational pageant quean you think\nothers would agree yes yes all right\nlet's see you may have seen the kind of\nvideo circulating Tik Tok or YouTube\nshorts where people are just raing each\nother based on their looks so when\nsomeone says you're a five we don't\nusually take it as a flattering comment\nand so what's the deal with that why is\nthe physical attractiveness 1 to 10\nrating scales so controversial well it's\nunclear when this concept of rating\npeople's looks on a number scale first\nstarted but it does seem to be quite a\nModern Trend social media has also made\nit quite trendy to rate people's looks\nalmost as if it's a game you'll find\nYouTube shorts Tik toks and even various\nsubreddits all asking to rate each\nother's physical attractiveness and\npeople love this stuff too it isn't even\na fringe concept the 1 to 10 rating\nscale it's almost a standardized unified\nway that we use to get the idea across\nof how physically attractive someone is\nin simple speak this is attempt to boil\ndown a person's physical attractiveness\nto a single communicable number A 1 a\ntwo a three a four a 10 maybe even and\nwe can say that the majority of people\nwould agree that the scale does a pretty\npoor job at communicating how physically\nattractive someone is because it's very\none-dimensional but there may be some\nother ways that we can use it\neffectively which we'll cover in this\nvideo so in this video let's try to talk\nabout the 1 to 10 scale break it down\nand see if it actually holds true when\ntrying to rate your own attractiveness\nthe basic premise behind the scale is to\nrate an individual's physical\nattractiveness apart from personality or\nother non-physical factors a 10 in\ntheory should represent the most\nattractive people in the world or the\nlevel of looks you'd see among the\nworld's say top models and yes we use\nthe word of top models because they do\nexist and social media has made that a\ntrend of being all the more obvious to\neveryone there is an oversaturation of\ngood-look people so the scope of what\nmakes a nine or a 10 has in theory broad\nend and is a lot more accessible we can\nthink of back to as recent as the early\n2000s where only 5% of people would be\nusing social media or in the common\nsense it didn't even exist and today the\nnumber is more like 60% globally and\nabout 90% in the US according to our\nworldin data article that doesn't even\nfactor in the great deal of hours that\nwe actually spend on social media and in\ntheory the amount of tens that we see\nnow is a lot higher than ever before\nalmost like an attractiveness inflation\nthis is well documented and we did make\na video on this on on Tik Tok which\ncovers the theory behind this being\naverage looking in your normal\nday-to-day life just doesn't seem to cut\nit anymore even though most people\naround you are still mathematically\naverage or the mean of the population\nyou could certainly create unique 1 to\n10 rating skills where you hear people\nsay things like an la6 is a 10 elsewhere\nwe can also look at beauty standards in\nthe west versus the east in terms of\ntheir differences in Beauty culture and\nthere will certainly be some differences\nin the facial traits that are being\npreferred still there is no doubt that\nthe 1 to 10 rating scale as a function\nof a linear scale today is a lot less\nforgiving than it would have been 100\nyears ago as we've explained on the\nchannel before if we really want to\nassign statistics to the rating scale it\nwould look a lot more like this this is\na gaussian curve or the normal bell\ncurve where most people fall right in\nthe middle around 4 to 6 out of 10 and\nwe see this with almost all human traits\ntake height weight speed all of them\ngenerally like beauty also have a normal\ndistribution and there's a good amount\nof sevens here and a few eights there\nand above that is how it should work in\ntheory but there's also new research\ncoming out showing that this scale could\nbe skewed because of our Reliance on\nplastic surgery people having better\nnutrition and in general greater\ninequality between those who can afford\nto look good and those who cannot if\nyou've watched our previous video on the\ntopic it also seems that when asked most\npeople rate themselves a 7 out of 10 and\nthat mathematically cannot be the case\nwithout Distributing this curve\ndifferently funnily enough recent by\nCooper atal shows this exact phenomenon\nfrankly we can call it delusion but it\napplies to pretty much everyone and it's\nnot something we do to be spiteful or\nmalicious the study asked what\nUniversity students would rate\nthemselves from 1 to 10 and\nunsurprisingly about onethird of the\nstudents gave themselves a seven making\nit the most frequently chosen rating the\nseven was also the most frequent rating\nchosen as the lowest rating that they\nwould date at the same time more than\nhalf of the students said a 10 was the\nhighest attractiveness level they would\ndate and the men in in the study really\nseem to stand firm on the importance of\nlooks while women said more personality\nfocused aspects like most people that\nare above A7 tend to know and be\nconceited if he wasn't conceited I'd be\nable to date him everyone has their own\ninterpretation of the 1 to 10 scale\nwhere you often even see people rating\nthemselves an 11 this is actually the\nfirst reason the scale doesn't do a good\njob of telling you how attractive you\nare two different people could have\ncompletely different perceptions of what\na seven means to them to one person a\nseven could basically mean average look\nbut to another it may mean that you're\nactually above average which is the\ncorrect mathematical definition however\nthere is also a fine line between trying\nto rate Beauty and reducing people to a\nnumber based on their appearance or a\nfixed perception like we've mentioned\nearlier there is also not a single\nUniversal Beauty standard even on this\nchannel we look at western eastern and\nperhaps some other micronations of\nbeauty standards to better understand\nwhat we're talking about in context\nlater in the video we'll also try to\nbreak down how you can rate your own\nattraction\naccurately but for now let's look at\nsome examples of how not to rate someone\nopen your mouth I need to see the\nteeth a you got a good face but you need\nto get your teeth fixed I'm going to\ngive the face an a fix the teeth the\nbody a nine and the sex appeal a seven\nthe show are you hot just took the idea\nof raiding people and ran with it as the\nwhole premise for their show it featured\nsome harsh comments from their judges\nand it seems to have shown no regard for\npeople's feelings where judging\nsomeone's physical appearance is\nparticularly sensitive because it is one\nof those things that is difficult to\nchange especially if we're talking about\nbone structure most importantly the show\nis public and it is difficult for a lot\nof people to accept so what we can take\naway from this is that it's probably not\na good idea to rate other people's\nappearances especially if the rating\ncomes from overly critical commentary\nabout features that you can't\nparticularly change so we have kind of\nalluded to this earlier but the main\nthing that prevents the 1 to 10 scale\nfrom being useful is cognitive bias\nthere are various biases that our brains\nwill deploy almost as if we're bending\nreality in a way that is more pleasing\nto us and on this channel we've covered\nalmost all of the ones that relate to\nBeauty previously we've touched on the\nDunning Krueger effect as one type of\nbias where in this case less attractive\npeople tend to overestimate how\ngood-look they are because they simply\ndon't know how much more there is to\nlooks on the other hand more attractive\npeople tend to give themselves a lower\nrating because they know how much more\nthere is to looks and so their\nself-esteem is lower thinking that\nthey're not good enough you haven't\nreally changed the reality of how good\nlooking you are to everyone else but\nyour brain is making you think that\nyou're a 10 when you may be a seven a 10\ncould also see themselves in terms of a\nseven because they have lower\nself-esteem there are other\npsychological biases as well such as\nfestinger's theory of social comparison\nwhich suggests that people have an\ninnate drive to evaluate themselves\noften in comparison to others various\nemotions like jealousy can come into\nplay when making those types of\ncomparisons so imagine you're comparing\nyourself say the conventionally\nattractive girl in your group and in\ndoing so your brain may try to\nsubconsciously lower her rating so now\ninstead of her being a nine she is a\nseven in your mind you may not even be\naware that you're doing it that is why\nthe concept is called an unconscious\nbias by lowering her rating you are\neffectively boosting your attractiveness\nrating since it's all relative to the\nmost attractive girl in this example of\nthe group and while yes it is true that\nhumans are partial to ourselves and\nbiased when it comes to pretty much\nanything we fortunately do have ways to\ncheck ourselves this is done through\nempirical evidence or experiments where\nwe can control these biases in other\nwords we're making the rating process\nmore clinical or emotionally detached\nand that's kind of what this whole\nchannel is basically about obviously\nevery person watching this does not have\nthe means to conduct a controlled\nexperiment on their own physical\nattractiveness but we can still take a\nfew key points that will help us rate\nour own appearances and perhaps\naccurately judge physical improvements\nthat we can make to look better every\nyear maybe you've had a glow up but you\ncan't seem to objectively tell if you\nare that much more attractive the first\nthing in that case in order to rate\nyourself accurately and even others is\nto be mindful of your biases on this\nchannel we've made a particular video\nthat covers the types of beauty biases\nthat influence how we look at people and\nif you go through that you'll be quite\naware of all the ways our mind plays\ntricks on us this may sound simple but\neven being aware of the biases\nthemselves their existence will make it\na lot easier to tell where you stand the\nsecond is to gain knowledge in that area\nif it's facial Aesthetics then you have\nto know what makes an attractive face\ntraining the eye as Leonardo da Vinci\nfamously called it and in this case we\nwant research based knowledge on what\nmakes physical features desirable we've\nmade plenty of videos on that exact\ntopic here at CS because that's what we\ndo but the reason this is so important\nis because it adds a bit of objectivity\nto the rating just like in the Dunning\nKrueger case when you don't know how\nmuch more there is to know you're not\ngoing to be able to rate people\naccurately because you think that beauty\nends here and that's all in fact there\nare many studies much like this by fors\natal that try to answer these exact\nquestions like what is the most\nattractive jaw shape what does an\nattractive side profile look like or\nwhat do the most attractive eyes look\nlike and these studies often have two or\nmore groups of observers there are lay\npeople or just normal people that don't\nknow much about the science behind\nfacial attractiveness and the other\ngroups are actual clinicians they could\nbe orthodontist plastic surgeons or any\nother practitioner that has experienced\nputting these concepts of what makes an\nattractive face to actual people the\nratings often are between different\ngroups because they have different\ninformation bases for judging\nattractiveness and often times the\northodontist or the clinicians and the\nlay people slightly different\ndefinitions of what makes an attractive\nface and that's why it's really\nimportant that we learn the theory\nbehind it at the same time we don't\nreally need science to tell us when\nsomeone is attractive I me just think\nabout it you look at her face you either\nlike it or you don't even with all of\nthe research artificial intelligence and\nthe top Minds at our disposal have still\nbeen unable to find a way to fully\ncapture or quantify what makes a face\nattractive until that changes the best\nway is just using a trained eye your\ntrained eye our eyes are surprisingly\ngood at quickly Discerning an attractive\nversus unattractive face if someone is\nexceptionally beautiful we can just tell\nand most of us don't lie at the extremes\nsay something like a three or above an\neight so these biases make a big\ndifference in how we perceive Beauty\nmost of us lie in the middle ground\nwhere a little bit of bias can knock us\ndown from a S to a six which is not\nactually a linear decrease as we've seen\nin the bell curve distribution or even\nboost us from a 5 to a 7\nand to sum this up a knowledgeable and\nunbiased eye is the best way to rate\nyourself from a one to a 10 so this is\neasier said than done because being\nhonest with yourself can be tough unless\nyou can gather a group of the world's\ntop plastic surgeons or modeling Scouts\nand ask them to rate your appearance\nthis is the best way to rate yourself on\nthe 1 to 10 scale where you become the\neye of the plastic surgeon or the\nmodeling scal instead of having to hire\nthem for any words a spoken an\nindividual's appearance is his or her\nfirst line of nonverbal communication\nwith the world being a nine on the look\nscale can certainly be an advantage\ndon't need me to tell you that just like\nbeing a 9 out of 10 in intelligence or\nCharisma but a rating of 1 to 10 on your\nappearance doesn't capture all of what\nmakes you you in fact it doesn't even do\na good job of capturing your appearance\nand that's why we also argue that the\nrating scale is very flawed and in all\nof our aesthetic reports everywhere in\nthe C's company we don't actually give\nout ratings to anyone because again it's\nflawed so with that being said while we\ndon't give out ratings of 1 to 10 in any\nof our products you can still order a\ncomprehensive facial aesthetic\nassessment to get a better understanding\nof what would theoretically make you a\nrating if that's what you're after\nwithout the rating itself in other words\nexplanation criticisms and positives and\nnegatives of your face that make you\nattractive and can also help the way you\nchange your aesthetic all of that done\nby a team of professional researchers\ndoctors and dentists and that's all\navailable over at's website as for now\nI'll catch you in the next one"}]}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "the face or the body which one is\nactually more important for overall\nphysical attractiveness and this is the\nage-old question we're going to try to\ntake a look at in this video you see the\nface and the body provide different\nsignals to our brain about a person's\ngenetic quality and other factors of\ntheir health such as body fat levels\nwe're going to discuss what these\nsignals are and reveal which ones are\ncrucial for overall perceived\nattractiveness but the answer to this\nquestion is not as straightforward as\nyou may think as contextual factors can\ninfluence where our attention is\ndirected either towards the body or\ntowards the face\nso to answer this question we need to\ntake a look at how physical attraction\nworks from an evolutionary perspective\nattractiveness serves as a cue to the\nquality of an individual as a potential\nmating partner Charles Darwin identified\nthe importance of physical\nattractiveness in mate Choice back in\nthe 19th century and although his focus\non men is outdated the concept Still\nRemains valid in today's sciences and\nthis raises a really good question why\ndo we perceive certain features as\nattractive according to Evolution\nattractive traits are associated with\nthe good genes hypothesis where we\nhypothesize that by being attractive you\nmust have health Youth and other\ndesirable social abilities and positive\nphysical characteristics and both the\nbody and the face can provide us those\ncues to desirable features desirable\nfacial characteristics could be Symmetry\naverageness and the traits associated\nwith masculinity or femininity also\ncalled sexual dimorphism we've covered\nthese Topics in our other videos on the\nchannel we interested watch these but on\nthe other hand bodily attractiveness is\noften related to other measures such as\nthe waist to hip ratio and the body mass\nindex even though the information\nreceived from the body and the face\ncannot be separated each one provides\nunique pieces of content that our brain\nprocesses subconsciously that are\ncomplementary to each other and reflect\ndifferent aspects of a person's mate\nquality\nso for instance spatial attractiveness\nsignals both health and certain\npersonality traits where people can look\nscary they can have scars on their face\nwhich can indicate aggression high\ntestosterone Etc but bodily\nattractiveness is more complex as it\nprovides different information depending\non whether you're looking at men or\nwomen obviously because female bodily\nattractiveness reveals information about\nfertility sexual maturity pregnancy even\nwhereas for men the body encodes\ninformation regarding physical strength\nathleticism dominance\nthese traits were once relevant for\nsurvival and the ability to provide\nresources to a family although they're\nless important in modern Western Society\nthey still have an impact in how we\nchoose Partners now that we've discussed\nthe signals given by the face and the\nbody for both men and women we have to\naddress the initial question which one\nis actually more important for physical\nattraction although both the face and\nthe body make a significant contribution\nthere are several studies suggest that\nfacial attractiveness is a stronger\npredictor of overall attractiveness than\nbodily attractiveness to understand what\nthis means let's take a look at the way\nscientists conduct the studies typically\nparticipants are shown photographs of an\nindividual and master rate their\nattractiveness the images would include\nwhole body face only or body only\nphotographs through data analysis\nresearchers can determine which aspect\nof attractiveness facial or bodily plays\na more significant role these studies\nshow that both the face and body are\nimportant in evaluations of overall\nattractiveness for both men and women\nhave a facial attractiveness tends to be\nmore important in mate Choice decisions\nas we've seen the face and body both\nconvey different signals to people there\nare several potential reasons why the\nface is generally more important than\nthe body one possibility is that the\nface is more genetically determined and\ntherefore a more reliable indicator of\nan individual's health and make quality\nwhere in bodily features they're more\nsubject to an individual's lifestyle\nchoices for example your body fat levels\nthis is called The Honest genetic Health\nindicator Theory where the harder a\nfacial feature is to change like your\nfacial development bone structure High\neven for your body then the more honest\nit is as an indicator of your genetic\nmakeup\nanother possible explanation is that the\nface conveys more information in less\nspace making even slight imperfections\nmuch more noticeable as they appear more\nclustered together in addition the face\nconveys social science such as interest\nor disinterest in another person which\nis also crucial in dating context and\nfinally clothes can alter or mask your\nbodily cues I mean how often do you see\na person's body in its full form and so\nthe face is a more accessible and again\ngoing back to the honesty Theory it is a\nmore honest indicator of your genetic\nquality because it cannot be masked as\neasily\nhowever the answer is not that simple\nlike with most things as we've discussed\nin other videos preferences for certain\nfacial traits depends on contextual\nfactors for both men and women for\nexample are you looking for a long term\nor a short-term partner the type of\nrelationship that somebody is seeking\ncan influence their perceptions of\nattractiveness does the preference for\nface over the body always apply or is it\nsituational to the dating context will\none study by confident colleagues\naddressed this question by showing\nparticipants covered photographs of\npotential partners and asking them which\npart of the body they would like to\nobserve if they were looking for a\nshort-term or a long-term relationship\nusing the Box removal procedure that\nthese authors came up with they found\nthat women preferred to reveal their\nface at almost the same rate for both\nlong-term and short-term dating contexts\naround 70 of the time and this suggests\nthat women's preferences for facial\nattractiveness is not affected by the\ndating scenario to them it's a very\nimportant thing how you look like other\nmen's interest in the face dropped from\naround 70 in the long-term context to\nless than 50 in the short-term context\nwhere they care more about the body in\nother words the attention of the man\nshifted towards bodily features like\ncurvaceousness when considering a\npotential partner for a short-term\nrelationship but for long-term\nrelationships the face was just as\nimportant\nso this raises the obvious question why\nare men more interested in bodily\nfeatures when seeking a short-term\npartner well this is related to the type\nof information that's conveyed by facial\nand bodily features in short-term dating\nimmediate sexual fertility becomes more\nimportant since the relationship is not\nexpected to last as long used to current\nfertility can be found in both the face\nand the body for example ovulation\ncauses women to experience any increase\nin perceived attractiveness and a\ndecrease in the waist to hip ratio which\nis considered an indicator of bodily\nattractiveness on the other hand for\nlong-term dating men Place more value on\na partner's potential fertility which is\ntypically associated with health and age\nthe expected future fertility is also\nsignaled by both base and body for\nexample having pockmarked acne ridden\nskin could reveal a history of disease\nand therefore is considered an\nunattractive feature while having long\nlegs is correlated with a lower risk of\nacquiring several diseases believe it or\nnot if both current and future fertility\ncan be conveyed by both base social and\nbodily features then why do men shift\ntheir interest towards the body in\nshort-term dating context or scientists\ndon't really fully understand the reason\nyet it's possible that a woman's face\nprovides richer information regarding\nher potential fertility whereas her body\nreveals more important cues to her\ncurrent fertility but this implies that\nwhen men are seeking current fertility\nthey tend to focus on the body and when\nthey're seeking future fertility for a\nlong-term partner they tend to focus on\nthe face but why are women's preferences\nindependent of the dating context well\nsince men's fertility doesn't decline as\nmuch with age as women's fertility does\nwomen have not evolved to attend to\nfertility cues more than the other cues\nof a man such as his strength his power\nwealth resources those factors in the\nsame way that men have attended to\nfertility cues above all else this means\nthat women are not programmed to be\ninterested in other factors such as a\nman's fertility as much as men are\ntherefore there is a difference between\nmen and women in their exceptions of\nattractiveness in short-term dating\nconditions when fertility is more\nimportant for men\nbased on the evidence so far it appears\nthat the face is generally more\nimportant than the body when it comes to\nattractiveness of this could be due to\nthe fact that the face is typically more\nvisible than the body\nin their paper face and body independent\npredictor of women's attractiveness the\nauthors used photographs of women\nwearing either casual clothes or bikinis\nto explore the topic then discovered\nthat both facial and bodily features\nplay a role in overall attractiveness in\nboth casual clothing and body exposed\nscenarios however women in casual\nclothes facial attractiveness was more\nstrongly linked to full body\nattractiveness and bodily features this\nis reflected in the first graphic where\nthe data points are more tightly packed\nwith the higher correlation and\ninterestingly when women wore bikinis\nthere was no significant difference\nbetween the facial and the bodily in\nterms of their contribution to the\noverall attractiveness\nthese findings indicate that men tend to\nconsider more faces or the body\ndepending on how exposed or mass the\nbody is essentially the more visible the\nbody is the more it influences\nperceptions of attractiveness and\nunfortunately these Studies have been\nperformed for male observers only so we\ndon't know if the conclusions hold true\nfor women\nit is important to note that while the\nstudies are interesting and these\nresults provide some insight clothed\nbodies provide a more realistic picture\nof how people actually perceive you in\neveryday life therefore while the\nresults on exposed bodies are relevant\nin specific contexts or normal dating\nsituation the facial features are more\nimportant in determining overall\nattractiveness\nand so to answer our initial question\nboth bodily and facial appearances\ncontribute to overall attractiveness\nwith a stronger influence on facial\nfeatures as indicated by the scientific\nliterature on the topic one limitation\nof these studies is that they rely on\nphotographs which provide only static\ninformation in reality the movement and\ndynamics of both the body and the face\nplay a crucial role in attraction for\nexample the way a person moves can\nindicate their physical coordination\nwhile facial expressions can reveal\npersonality traits and dating intentions\nfuture studies will clarify how factors\nrelated to movement affect\nattractiveness which is a topic we're\ngoing to cover on this channel so if\nthat

one\nof the best looking women in the\nHollywood space for a while now and even\nBeauty culture in general does talk\nabout her looks what specific is eonomic\nfeatures and cephalometric proportions\nmake her a great pick Bobby that's a\nquestion that no one asked but we're\ngonna answer anyway and furthermore what\npeople do care about is what makes a\nface so attractive this video wouldn't\nbe complete without a discussion about\nMargaret's Shoreline this isn't really\nthe part of her face that particularly\nallows her to play Barbie but it does\ncontribute greatly to her look now\nMargaret jaw doesn't seem to fit all of\nthe standards of a quote-unquote\nbeautiful feminine Jewel at least\naccording to the various literatures on\nthe topic however let's not kid\nourselves that Margaret doesn't have an\nattractive jawline it just does not lean\nheavily into the feminine ideals being\nmore on the masculine side research by\nrakabi atal actually our surgeons\northodontists and lay people their\nperspective on the beautiful female\njawline so let's try to break down their\nfindings and see if I applies to Margo\nkeep in mind though that researchers ask\ndifferent groups or Reason as the\neducation of the Observer can slightly\nalter their perceptions of beauty as\nwell as sensitivity to changes in\nspecific features and what you find most\nattractive may not exactly be the same\nas what the surgeon determines to be\nmost attractive firstly let's discuss\nmargot's sure width which is called the\nintegonial width the researchers\nPhotoshop different dual wits as a\nproportion of the cheekbone width or the\ninter-zygomatic width all the way from\n116 to 72 percent basically a range of\ndual widths from super wide to narrow\nwe're not going to get too caught up on\nthe specific number and we'll explain\nwhy in a bit but before finding out what\nthey consider ideal or most attractive\nlet's analyze Margaret's Jewel with\nvirtual width is about 87 of her\ncheekbone width which would fall right\nabout here in the diagram all of the\nRaiders actually favored narrower Jaws\nwhere the surgeons and orthodontists\nprefer the narrowest shore and the lay\npeople preferred the second narrowest\nthat might look something like this on\nMargot so test if you could indeed find\nit more attractive and a well-rounded\nhandbook by Dr William prother called\ncontemporary Orthodontics also\nsubjectively notes that the integonial\nwidth or the jaw width should be the\ndistance between the two horizontal\nlines dropped from the outer canthus\nthat does closely align with the\nproportion they found in this paper but\nthe researchers do know a beautiful\nrange of 72 to 86 percent which is right\nnear where Margo stands so it's not that\nunusual either still though the issue\nwith this study is that while the\nresults were significant everyone has a\ndifferent face narrower Jewel might not\nharmonize well with Margaret's broader\nand taller forehead or her facial height\nand so on in this study they just showed\naltered photos of one face and one\nfeature wherever facial Beauty might be\naffected by the ethnicity of the person\nand the cultural ethnicity of the judges\nas well as well as numerous other\nsocioeconomic factors demographic\neducational determinants and so on as\nwell this is why we don't get caught up\nwith the specific number the takeaway is\nthat narrower Jaws do seem to trend on\naverage be preferred in women at least\nwithin reason and in line with the\nconcept of normalcy or averageness on\ntop of this Margo also has a\nmasculinizing jaw characteristics with a\nmore acute dual angle and a longer ramus\nwe've made other videos that go into\nfurther detail on these but the ramus is\na highly dimorphic trait men typically\nhave longer ramuses or Rey my and this\nis so dimorphic that you can tell the\nsex of a disease skull simply by the\nshape of the jaw Rami overall we can\ncharacterize her jaw as more masculine\nbut that doesn't necessarily mean that\nshe has an unattractive jaw the jaw just\ndoesn't lie if the extremes like say\nOlivia Wilde also in the same paper\nMargaret fits the same preferences for\nfemale jaw angles positioned almost at\nthe level of the mouth Corner according\nto the judges this view here is what is\ncalled the oblique three-quarter View\nand the judges tried to determine what\nthe most attractive position of the\njorgonian or this point here was you can\nsee just like before a bunch of\ndifferent variations of draw position\nthe image 2 here was found to be the\nmost attractive where the dualgonian was\nin line with the mouth argot doesn't\nperfectly fit that standard but she is\nwithin an attractive range it also seems\nlike the draw Remus in that study was\naltered to be more vertical which also\ngives the jaw a boxy look now it doesn't\nseem to have that issue in the oblique\nview so her jaw doesn't appear overly\nboxy and this is the key characteristic\nwhile the draw may be more masculinized\nit isn't masculine Marga also fits the\nconventional standards of a lean and\nwell-defined jawline irrespective of her\nactual bone structure in the west there\nis a high preference for bases with eye\nfacial robusticity basically sharp\nangular features both for men and women\nit has low levels of some mental fat\nwhich creates a defined angle from both\nthe neck and the chin which is\nattractive according to nine year tile\nstudy nobody's looking at Margaret Shaw\nand saying it's ugly because it's a bit\nmore on the masculine side with all of\nthat being said how does this fit into\nher Casting as Barbie well it's more or\nless all in the eyes as early as 1954\nwith researchers like Paul Sacco the\nquestions have been posed like what\nfaces perceived to correspond with what\npersonality type Spirit curves were not\nSpecialists on Barbies but when you\nthink of Barbie you think of a gleeful\nexcitable and friendly personality since\nBarbie is a live action film the\ndirectors want to do the best job of\ncarrying that over to the screen in a\nsense casting directors must ask\nthemselves a same question posed by\nsecond it refers to an outdated concept\ncalled physionomy where we try to assert\nan individual's personality characters\nethics and so on just based solely on\ntheir appearance specifically the facial\nappearance in this context are the\ncasting directors they assumingly chose\nMargaret because her face reflects that\nBarbie Persona it isn't just about being\nblonde with blue eyes I mean if you look\nat all of these models it wouldn't have\ntoo hard of a job as being a convincing\nBarbie either the actual facial\nstructure and layout of the features\nmatter more than the coloring of the\nfeatures themselves this looks inference\nmethod of thinking can be dated back as\nfar as 500 BC where Pythagorean scores\nchose their students based on how they\nlooked even Aristotle noted a high\nforehead means that an individual is\nsluggish or large ears means a person\nengages in a lot of silly chatter and\nobviously none of this is true but what\nis true is that we do make immediate\njudgments of a person's personality\nwhether it's correct or not based on how\nthey look straight away and we know that\nthis is quite a ridiculous assumption to\nmake however with modern scientific\nprocesses we can test if there is any\ntruth behind this idea of physionomy and\nthere does seem to be a little bit of\nTruth to every lie it's not in the way\nthat Aristotle thought it's not as if\nyou can point to Margaret's High\nforehead and say she is quick-witted or\na poor decision maker or lazy or any\nnumber of unrelated personality traits\nthat the ancient Greeks might have\nthought there is no research to support\nthat and we're certainly not saying that\nat all however our facial morphology the\nshape itself of our facial features does\naffect how others perceive us research\nby rule in 2016 as well as older\nresearch on the topic in 1985 by Keating\nestablished a connection between facial\nshape and perceptions of dominance for\nexample as various facial features like\nthe jewels eyebrows eyes were altered to\nbe more mature the bases were perceived\nas more dominant this may be surprising\nto you or perhaps not but increasing the\ndominance in male faces made them more\nattractive while the opposite was true\nfor women for example if we give\nMargaret more mature features\nparticularly in the eyes because that is\nwhere the effect is strongest we found\nor a singly manipulated facial feature\nthat she does become less attractive\nagain the point of the video isn't to\nlook at Barbie dolls you don't even have\nto have ever touched a Barbie doll to\nknow that they don't appear dominant or\nthreatening that's just not look they\ntypically have larger eyes and more\nneonate features in general and they\njust do look non-threatening and the\nsame can be said about Margaret's eyes\nshe has a traditionally feminine or\ndimorphic eye region that actually does\nmake her a perfect fit with the casting\nof Barbie one thing that is quite\ninteresting is that when the research is\npresented combinations of altered\nfeatures the results weren't as clear as\nmanipulating a single feature that is\nsomething worth considering and perhaps\nwhy Margo largely benefits from the\nattractiveness of feminine and\nnon-dominant eyes even while having a\nmore masculine jaw structure all of this\nmakes sense if we think about it from a\nsociobiological perspective our initial\nimpressions of others use physical\nattractiveness with stereotyping gender\nNorms or social dominance his arguments\nare supported by Common observations of\neminent Beauty techniques for example\nsuch as makeup techniques for making the\neyes rounder at least when this paper\nwas written the typical prescription for\nbeauty in Western culture included\nmaking the eyes look larger browse\nthinner and arched much like Margaret's\nnatural eyes some of that may have\nchanged with beauty standards such as\nthe bigger eyebrows nail but the general\nconcept does still apply today\nespecially if you look at Eastern Beauty\nCulture by comparison even in various\nnon-human species like Harris sparrows\nhorn size in mountain sheep and graying\nin the mountain gorilla are\nmorphological features meant to Signal\nsexual maturity and dominance in this\nsense Marga has larger palpable height\nand palpable width which simply means\nthat she has larger eyes which is again\nfemininely sexually dimorphic her eyes\nare also quite wide and upturned which\nresearchers call palpable axis among\nother terms along with wides this is an\nattractive trait in women according to\nquantitol where Barbie dolls tend to\nexaggerate this feature to a great\ndegree no human really has eyes that are\nthat upturned so Margaret is as close as\na face could get without looking\ncartoonish as for her eyebrows they are\nnot brooding but rather moderately\npositioned above her eyes not appear\noverly dominant or docile additionally\nher distinct brow Arch is a\ntraditionally feminine feature that you\nobviously weren't commonly find in men a\nlot of that has to do with the\nmorphology of the brow bone itself and\nit's clear that Margaret has a feminine\nbrow Ridge with all of that said none of\nher features are overly exaggerated to\nappear cartoonish or non-average like an\nactual Barbie Margaret essentially looks\nlike how a Barbie would look as a real\nperson close to it and the answer is\nsimple as that the reason why she is so\nattractive is because she displays a\nxenomous signs of non-dominance in the\neyes which we link to attractiveness in\nwomen while remaining proportionate and\nharmonious symmetrical dimorphic and all\nthe other characteristics that make a\nface attractive in general but other\nfacial features like the lips nose skin\nand jaw are also high in what's known as\ncoinophilia or averaginous meaning that\nthey are representative of the average\nwhite woman's face Margaret fits the\nattractive mold of her face with high\naverageness and one or two non-average\nor exceptional facial features which\nwe've covered in our previous podcast\nepisodes is the key to making an\nattractive and memorable face where you\nhave a baseline of attractive features\nor attractive prerequisites and a couple\nof unique unique features that are\nespecially dimorphic that separates the\nface apart and makes people truly\nmemorable in her case it's her jaw and\neyes that both give her a unique look so\nshe doesn't look like any other blonde\nwith blue eyes we couldn't get into\nevery feature of hers in this video but\nhopefully that lends some Credence into\nwhy casting directors would choose a\nface like Margo's though they aren't\nanalyzing her face like we just broke it\ndown here but usually they do have a\nfeel for what face gives off what vibe\nit seems that they made the right\ndecision with Margaret for Barbie but\nwill be able to tell for sure when we\nactually see her in the role just a\nquick note on Ken we did make a analysis\nof Ryan Gosling's face which is very\nwell casted for somebody like Ken who is\nmore of a himbo and I don't know what\nthe word would be a male did and for\nthose reasons Ken is is more of an\nappropriate role if you don't believe\nthat to be true just think of some hyper\nmasculine man playing Ken such as I\ndon't know Jason Momoa it wouldn't just\nreally be the same would it Margaret has\na few Hollywood look-alikes if you've\never seen Samara weaving or Jamie\nPresley but these subtle facial features\narguably make Margo more conventionally\nattractive and a better fit for Barbie\nwhat do you think what's Margo the best\npick for Bobby or do you think someone\nelse would have made a better asking\nchoice so with that being said if you\nlike the way that we broke down the face\nhere and if you'd like to analyze your\nface and with much more Candor and\nperspective you would like to change the\nway that you look at a second opinion of\na team of doctors and dentists take a\nlook over at the coup's

Hypothesis\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "today we're going to look at a\nfascinating topic why you date people in\nyour league and before we get too deep\ninto the subject let's just quickly\nclarify what that means when we refer to\ndating within your leagues we're talking\nabout finding a partner who shares a\nsimilar level of physical attractiveness\nto you and this concept isn't new by any\nstretch of the imagination the matching\nhypothesis has been long suggested in\nPsychology that we try to maximize our\nsuccess of finding an attractive partner\nbut also minimizing our chances of\nrejection and so we end up dating people\nwithin our league more or less but\nthere's actually a lot more to that that\nwe're going to cover so let's get into\nthe Nuance of things the emergence of\ndating apps over the last decade has\nquite significantly impacted how we\nchoose our partners on the surface\ndating apps appear simple you swipe on\nthose that you're interested in and hope\nfor a mutual connection however dating\napps are not as innocent as they may\nseem because beneath that Pleasant\ninterface a complex network of\nalgorithms dictate who you're shown to\nand who you get to see some dating apps\nlike once assess your attract and then\naim to match you with Partners within\nyour league by deliberate design other\nwell-known apps like Bumble are rumored\nto rank Beauty and employ a similar\nsystem of scoring and the theory is that\nthey utilize a ELO system variant which\nwas initially developed to match chess\nplayers with similar skill level in\ntournaments to explain it very quickly\nimagine a hierarchy of scores and you\nhave people who are very attractive who\nget swiped out by everyone on the app\nwhether it's male or female and they're\nhigh up on their rankings if that person\nwho has high up wipes right on somebody\nwho they're attracted to but that person\nmight be lower on the rankings than that\nlower person gets a significant boost\nand climbs up the rank to eventually get\ncloser to the attractive person at the\ntop however if a lot of people and not\njust one person but a lot collectively\ndecide that this attractive person at\nthe top isn't that attractive anymore\nand they all swipe left which you know\nlet's be honest very rarely ever happens\nthen that person will lose their ranking\nand come back down these findings\nindicate that within the context of\nonline dating there is the powerful\nillusion of choice if you date online\nand you end up with someone in your\nleague this Choice may result from\ntargeted algorithms rather than your own\ndecision studies suggests that in\ngeneral everyone desires a partner who\nis more physically attractive than\nthemselves obviously according to\nprioritol people prefer individuals\nwhose mate value is higher than their\nown indicating what's known as an\naspirational matching strategy however\nthey also found that more closely\nmatched couples actually report higher\nlevels of relationship quality and\npartnership length and this finding\nsuggests that you could have better\noptions even if you desire a partner\nthat's out of your league by simply\nlooking more towards somebody that's\ncloser to you the observable success of\nclosely matched couples in society\nlikely contributes to why people tend to\njust go within their league rather than\nfollowing their aspirational matching\nstrategies another study conducted by\nTaylor atal found evidence that people\noften pursued others who were similar in\nterms of physical attractiveness\nself-worth and popularity they\ndiscovered that everyone one preferred\nthe most attractive Partners but only\nhighly attractive people actually\npursued them an interesting key word\nhere is pursue where less attractive\nindividuals sought out less attractive\nPartners despite their preferences for\nthe more attractive Partners likely due\nto the fear of rejection if you're\ninterested in this I made a very\ndetailed podcast episode on this that\nwas quite interesting on the fear of\nrejection hypothesis then they followed\nup that study with people who dated\nonline and found that users often\nattempted to contact others out of the\nleague and it's no surprise why with\nonline dating the stakes of being\nrejected are very low people don't have\nto reject you verbally they can just\nchoose not to respond and so this leads\nmany users to use a shotgun approach\nwhere they can contact many attractive\nindividuals and just hope for a match\nunsurprisingly who would have guessed\nthis approach doesn't actually pay off\nfor users in the study and these\ncontacts were often not reciprocated for\nexample a 7 out of 10 hypothetically\ncontacting a 10 out of 10 hypothetically\nrarely receives a response instead users\ntypically only got answers back from\npeople within their league but it seems\nthat daters took their own shot with\nmore attractive users but their efforts\nwere unsuccessful to conclude these\nvarious findings nearly everyone\nexpresses a preference for a more\nattractive partner however the main\nreason you date people within your\nleague is likely due to not being\nselected by those that are more\nattractive than you another key\ncontributing factor to why most people\ndate within their leagues is simply\nenvironment and proximity Theory people\noften make friends and find romantic\npartners with those around them meaning\nwhere you spend your time shapes your\ndating pool aside from the gym the idea\ncan be observed in other venues like\nyour school the university workplace\nthat you go to and if we use University\nas an example you're more likely to be\naround others who are a similar age and\nlifestyle when you're attending your\nclasses where you create an environment\nof people more within your league the\nmain idea being anything that brings you\ncloser to others like you contributes to\nwhy you date within your league when\nchoosing a partner High physical\nattractiveness a great personality and\nshared interests rank highly on most\npeople's lists however underlying\npsychological factors usually influence\nthese decisions as well Christian\nmccallum's and colleagues found that\nbeautiful people are often tempted by\nother romantic options resulting in\nlower quality relationships and more\nbreakups unsurprisingly they also found\nthat attractive people are hit on more\nmaking them more likely to respond\nfavorably to romantic advances by others\ndue to the options that beautiful people\nhave being in a relationship with one\ncan be pretty daunting not to say that\nmany people couldn't tolerate their\npartner getting hit on but for many it\nwould push them towards a partner more\nwithin their league imagine going out to\na social event and seeing your partner\nget hit on all the time well that's a\nflattering compliment to you as well\nthat experience isn't desirable for a\nlot of people and a lot of people are\ninsecure about factors like this when\nyou date someone within your league you\ntypically feel more assured that you and\nthem are an equal physical\nattractiveness footing and then you'll\nfeel more secure that you won't have\ncompetition hitting on them whenever\nyou're not around because you can also\nbenefit from the same undoubtedly the\npsychology of dating context does matter\na lot as well especially if we're\ntalking long term or short-term dating\npartners and so there you have it that's\nfour different answers to the question\nof why most people date within their\nleague which isn't a bad thing as we've\nshown it does result in better\nrelationship satisfaction however from\npersonal experience proximity Theory\nwould probably be the most important\ncharacteristic to this question because\nhow and who you spend your time with\ndoes shape more than just your spouse\nbut also the rest of your life as well\nyou want to date a more attractive\npartner you yourself must become more\nattractive if you want to date a wealthy\nperson who may be one percent in their\nfield then you yourself must be a one\npercent person in some other field to be\nconsidered equivalent while there are\nmany works of literature such as crazy\nRich Asians and 50 Shades of Gray which\nplay on the theme of attractive\nsuccessful person marrying down and\nthat's you know obviously they're\nmarrowing down because that's the whole\npoint of the premise in reality it's\nmore like Brooklyn Beckham marries\nNicola Pelt when it comes to successful\npeople marrying within their social\nclass and circle in other words the\nmatching hypothesis so with that being\nsaid if you're interested in learning\nmore about your face where you stand in\nthis hierarchy of things where your good\nand bad features are what are your\ncharacteristics that make up you consist\nof have an assessment

{"role": "assistant", "content": "where popular demand here are the 10\nmost important facial features for\nlooking attractive according to\nScientific literature Although our\nranking of the top 10 features is based\non scientific literature the order of\nimportance will obviously vary from\nperson to person and also quite\nsignificantly varies by gender ethnic\nbackground in environment as we've\ncovered so many times on this channel in\nthe past\n10. are your lips your lips are not as\nimportant for looking attractive as you\nmay think that's why they stand in at\nthe 10th position while the lips only\nhave a level of importance usually\nthey're not the feature that make or\nbreak the face that is unless they are\nunnaturally thin or full\nusually most people don't lie towards\neither extreme and nor are the lips a\nhighly noticeable or Salient feature of\nthe face also the lips are just one of\nthe isolated features for the most part\nunlike some of the others which come\ntogether with other facial\ncharacteristics\nstill the lips have a few different\ncomponents to them like the lip volume\nproportionality and the shape and lips\nthat are overly full or disproportionate\nin relation to the lower third can\ncertainly make you look less attractive\nbut it won't make you look ugly quote\nunquote on its own the Cupid's bow has\nbeen a historically sought after facial\nfeature as it adds Harmony to the lips\nand enhances their shape\nthere are also many ethnic variations to\nlip size and shape that one specific lip\nshape cannot be the universal Beauty\nstandard which is why it doesn't have a\nlarge impact on the face because there's\njust too much variation overall lips are\nimportant enough to make the list but\ncertainly not the most important facial\ncharacteristic or looking attractive a\nlot of Instagram models over emphasize\nhow much getting lip Thriller will give\nthem a boost in their attractiveness but\nin reality sometimes the results\nactually work in their disfavor where\nthey actually have a glow down\nthe ninth most important facial feature\narguably for looking attractive is teeth\nand dental health your smile is\nundoubtedly one of the most expressive\nand important facial characteristics\nwhere Henry and Brewer know that the\nteeth are an ornamental display or a\nrich source of genetic and environmental\ninformation about a person's face and\ntheir health\neveryone knows what bad teeth look like\nthey may be stained they may be yellow\ncrooked or even decaying in some cases\nwe associate unpleasant breath with bad\nteeth even apart from the visual\nunpleasantness so you can imagine how\nthere are multiple negative associations\nfrom just one facial characteristic\nwhich we don't see in other facial\nfeatures like the lips for example\nstill it's possible to have an\nattractive face with teeth that are not\nperfectly pearly white researchers know\nthat it's just the yellowing of the\nteeth that makes a subject less\nattractive winding Beyond a natural\nlevel also doesn't provide any\nadditional benefit for this point we\naren't really talking about having an\nunderbite or improperly aligned teeth so\nwe're not talking about orthodontic\nissues rather just the teeth and the\ncolor themselves as that would be a much\nhigher point on the list which we'll\ncover in just a second we're referring\nto the Aesthetics of the teeth like\ntooth caps chipped crooked yellow teeth\nand we've made a video on teeth\nAesthetics here which will explain all\nof those factors in more detail but even\nthen your teeth won't make or break your\nfacial attractiveness in most cases\nbecause you can always just keep your\nmouth closed if you're insecure about\nyour teeth and it doesn't have this\npermanent effect on your face as some of\nthe other features I wrap on the list do\nmost people take for granted just how\nimportant skin health is for looking\nattractive and that's why the largest\norgan in your body is the eighth most\nimportant facial feature but why is it\nonly the eighth well you've seen acne\nTransformations especially after going\non Accutane it does have a significant\nimpact but at the same time it's not as\nimportant as some of the other factors\nwhich are arguably more significant\nfixing acne especially if it's severe\nwill result in a significant glow up and\nthat's undeniable this is because acne\nshrouds the beauty of facial features\nlike the nose the jaw the eyes and it\ndoes hide the underlying bone structure\nby detracting away your attention to the\nredness of the blemishes or the pustules\nthe nodules the scars even only that it\nalso gives you an unhealthy appearance\nbut it does detract attention from your\nfacial strong points still as long as\nyour skin is not severely acne ridden\nSun damaged or dry it won't necessarily\nmake or break your facial attractiveness\nwhich is why it's placed as a one pimple\nhere and there won't make say a model\nless attractive your skin does also\nsignal youth so it is really quite\nimportant to maintain that throughout\ndrinking water wearing sunscreen and\nother skin regiments like Retin-A but\noverall having a homogeneous or a smooth\nand consistent skin tone is going to\nboost your facial attractiveness by\nquite a bit but from a distance you\ncan't really tell the health of your\nskin and it doesn't really matter all\nthat much\nmen and women alike hair is quite\nunderrated when it comes to looking\nattractive that's why we rank it as\nnumber seven on this list of top 10. we\nall know that losing hair or balding is\nreally a big detractor for men's facial\nattractiveness in most cases even in\nwomen hair length style and volume have\nbeen shown in our previous videos with\nthe scientific literature to drastically\nalter facial attractiveness for example\nmesco and berseke note that the long and\nmedium length hairs had a significant\npositive effect on ratings of women's\nattractiveness as individuals who can\nafford the high cost of long hair are\nthose who have arguably good\nphenotypical and genetic quality because\nlong hair has both social costs and also\nHealth costs to maintain\nthis is why hair is a significant but\nmaybe not the most important facial\nfeature it is expressive in terms of\nsignaling our usefulness our health and\nfertility and with the vast amount of\nhairstyles out there a bad hairstyle can\ncompletely alter the perceived\nproportionality of your face for example\na top heavy hairstyle can make a long\nface look even longer but is also a\nstylistic and personality indicator too\nthe men facial hair also falls under\nthis category and it can add some extra\nmasculinity or mask a weaker Jewel for\nthe faces that needed so it does have\nthis benefit but it's not again the make\nor break\njust look at some of the most attractive\nactors or models out there and they\nalmost always have gray hair again this\nis just one of those features that won't\nmake or break the phase if you are\notherwise attractive but it is still\nvery important as providing a little bit\nof a boost here and there having unkempt\nhair can make you look less presentable\nand attractive and hair is especially\nimportant for those of us who don't have\nthe bone structure of runway models in\nproviding some facial adjustments\nthe sixth most important feature of the\nface is arguably the cheekbones also\ncalled the zygomatic bones these are\nwhat most people think of when they\nthink of runway models or any highly\nattractive face this is the point in the\nlist where it starts getting away from\nthe more superficial traits and into the\nactual bone structure of the face\nbecause this is quite literally what\nmakes you you unsurprisingly they rank\nhigh on the list because your cheekbones\nsit near your eyes and provide support\nfor the mid face they just make you look\nmore alert and Youthful when they're\nhigher at the same time having Hollow\ncheeks or incredibly sharp sculpted\ncheekbones are not a prerequisite for an\nattractive face because we've covered on\nthe channel plenty of cheekbones that\nare lower less defined but nonetheless\nstill there some level of cheekbone\ndevelopment is designed but they don't\nhave to be overly sharp high cheekbones\nare desired but not everyone has them\nthey just give more lift to the face and\nthey make you appear more striking and\nthus the cheekbones rank high in terms\nof importance but not that high up\nbecause they're not their prerequisite\nfor attractive faces this isn't to\ndownplay the the importance of the\ncheekbones but mogilski and Welling in\ntheir study also know that some of the\nother features on this list are more\nSalient than cheekbone prominence in\nterms of partner attractiveness they are\nimportant but just like the lips they're\noften over emphasized because they are\nalso identifiable\nthe nose seems to get a lot of attention\nin terms of being the most important\nfacial feature especially by women but\nthat's not actually true it is indeed\nquite important but it ranks as the\nfifth most important feature in our list\nbeing attractive for a very good reason\nthis includes things like nasal tip\nprojection or how far out the nose\nsticks the nasal tip shape the\nbulbousness the nasal base width those\nare all factors that matter as well when\nyou're talking about the nose but with\nthat being said there is a great deal of\nvariability in attractive in those\nshapes there isn't a one-size-fits-all\nnose but most attractive faces have at\nleast an acceptable nose that is within\nnormality for their general population\nnothing too big or too small or too\ncrazy looking just generally the average\nyou would expect as long as the nose is\nnot deformed broken lots of different no\nships can be attractive which is why\nit's not to make or break for a face but\nthere is a very high level of\nsensitivity when the nose is\ndisproportionate that's why it's\nperfectly placed at fifth not too\nimportant but not to be ignored either\nalong those same lines as long as your\nnose is not overly deviant from your\nethnic specific nose shape it will\nharmonize well with your face when it is\ndeviant it's very noticeable because the\nnose is dead center in the middle of\nyour face most attractive faces do have\nwood noses but the fact that we can find\nhighly attractive faces with all kinds\nof no shapes around the world means it\nwon't beat out some of the other\nfeatures on this list which are more\nimportant and less negotiable on\ndiversity\nyour face shape undoubtedly plays a\nlarge part in making you attractive\nthat's why we polluted at number 4 out\nof the top 10 and when talking about\nphase shapes in this specific context we\nare mainly referring to a very specific\ndefinition we are talking about the\nclinical definition of the facial index\nwhich is the length of your face\nrelative to its width additionally we\nalso have to consider the relative width\nof the facial thirds the upper the\nmiddle and the lower thirds\nall these different face shapes you've\nheard about such as your oval Square\nlong short medium heart shapes all stem\nfrom those two general dimensions and\nthey don't really matter more so because\nthere are attractive faces from all of\nthose categories\nwhat does matter is the facial index and\nthat basically means an attractive face\nhas a proportionate face shape that a\nface that is neither too long or Too\nShort or too wide or too narrow or with\nthe jaw or forehead that is not too\nbulbous if we're going to put a number\nto it let's just say according to reneke\nand for Eddie's paper your face should\nbe 1.35 times longer than it is wide for\nmen and 1.3 times in women which is the\npopulation average that we see all\nacross the world you find the most\nattractive faces around this range with\nsome exceptions such as male model\nJordan Barrett who we've covered in the\npast having a very wide face in line\nwith the concept of facial averages your\nbi-temporal or forehead width and\nbiconial or the Dual width should also\nbe around this similar width of your\ncheekbones usually around 80 to 90\npercent do not appear too wide or too\nnarrow\nwith all of that being said different\nphase shapes can be quite attractive so\nthere is some variability but as a\ngeneral rule almost all beautiful people\nhave a pleasant face shape making this a\nhighly important factor on the list\nbecause it does frame the entirety of\nyour face and your features\nI don't know if you were expecting this\nbut your eyebrows eyelashes and general\nbrow Ridge are the third most important\nfacial feature for making an attractive\nface it isn't cheating to Bunch all of\nthese features together but usually they\ncorrelate with one another in terms of\nexpression in part one we mentioned that\nthe cheekbone prominence was found to be\nthe least important among the features\nstudied by mogilski and Welling among\nthe features that beat cheekbone\nprominence was eyebrow thickness keep in\nmind this is simply the vertical\nthickness of the eyebrows there are a\nlot of other parts to an attractive\neyebrow like the color the shape density\nand position However the fact that\neyebrow thickness alone was on par with\nface shape in terms of importance and\nbeat out cheekbone prominence is very\nrevealing about their saliency and\nimportance in visual attention and on\ntop of that list that the attractive\nfeature of dark eyelashes and it's\nobvious why these rank so high on the\ntop 10 list women accentuate their\nlashes and bras for a reason it's\nbecause they completely alter your\nperceived attractiveness your brow Ridge\nor the glabella region is not entirely\nseparable from your eyebrows your\neyebrows sit on your brow Ridge for the\nunderlying bone does affect how\nattractive you are they also help make\nyour eyes more deep set which is\ngenerally considered attractive for men\nand to some degree for women too\nthe brow Ridge is one of the more\nsexually dimorphic features on the face\nwhere men usually have much more\nprominent brow ridges we've seen the\nresearch from 90 and Roads as well as\nothers that confirmed the importance of\nsexual dimorphism while being masculine\nlooking or feminine looking in facial\nattractiveness the brow Ridge does have\na role in controlling how masculine or\nfeminine your face looks depending on\nyour sex your eyes are the second most\nimportant facial feature for an\nattractive face and some people may put\nthis feature at number one but either\nway most people recognize this as one of\nthe more important facial features\nperhaps if we lumped eyebrows in this\nthen the whole eye region would be\nnumber one in this case your eyes refer\nto the spacing between your eyes your\neye shape color Health tilt or how\nupturned they are eyelid exposure and\nother unique deformities or features\nlike the limbo ring or under eye\ndarkness dark circles hollowing\ngenerally the whole periocular region\nthe distance between your eyes being\nwide or closed said makes a surprisingly\nlarge difference in how attractive you\nare the whites of your eyes or the\nsclera should also be white and healthy\nlooking rather than yellowish or red\nwhich looks sickly and again does have\nan impact on how attractive you are\neveryone seems to have unique eyes and\nour eye shape is a major part of that\nhow sharp narrow rounded upturned droopy\nour eyes are all affect our perceived\nattractiveness there are too many\nspecific features to delve into detail\nfor just this video but we have made\nvideos on this in the past but having\nwell spaced almond-shaped eyes is\ngenerally considered attractive again\nmany kinds of eyes can be considered\nbeautiful as long as they don't stray\ntoo far from normality or averageness\nfor your ethnic population\nthis is why the eyes are so crucial when\nit comes to looking attractive there are\njust too many moving Parts in the\nperiocular region and also one of the\nfirst things you look at is another\nperson's eyes\nno surprise here but your jaw is the\nmost important facial feature for\nattractiveness this is a broad feature\nas your jawline can be broken down into\nmore than five individual Parts such as\nyour chin upper jaw lower jaw Remus\nlength jaw body dual height anterior of\njaw length however when somebody says\nyou have a nice jawline they're talking\nabout the whole lower third or the Dual\ncomplex as a whole and all of these\nfeatures combined which is what makes\nthis so significant because there are so\nmany moving Parts again this is\nundoubtedly a very important feature for\nattractive faces I mean just go out on\nyour Tick Tock page and virtually every\nattractive person has a well-structured\njaw\nyou will see a bunch of different eye\nand eyebrow shapes among models however\nalmost all models and attractive\ncelebrities all have well-defined\nwell-structured jaw lines which are more\nor less the same which is why we put the\njaw above the eyes having a defined and\npleasant your angle is usually a\nprerequisite for an attractive face\nhaving a sharp jawline with lows of\nmental fat again something we see in\nalmost all attractive faces and so with\nthe jawline there is much less\nvariability compared to the eyes we've\nalso touched on how crucial one's draw\ndevelopment is for overall health\nindicators along with displaying your\nbody fat percentage having poor jaw\nalignment such as an overjet and\nunderbite or an overbite or the\northodontic definition of your face can\nmake simple tasks like chewing and\nspeaking more difficult in this sense\nhaving a healthy and attractive jaw is a\nuniversal and Timeless indicator of\nbeauty because beauty is defined as\nfunction and so having a dysfunctional\njaw does make your face less attractive\nthis doesn't mean that you need the most\nrobust fuel possible but it does mean\nthat you need a healthy jaw as the\nprerequisite or being attractive some\nhonorable mentions that didn't make the\nlist include your ears neck and facial\nSymmetry and these features can\ncertainly impact facial attractiveness\nespecially if you have really large\ndeviant ears but they aren't as\nimportant as some of the other factors\nthat we did put on the list most people\ndon't glaringly notice facial asymmetry\nbut symmetry is still important enough\nof an overarching feature to have but\ngenerally these characteristics come\nwith all of the others on the list and\nso if you have strong jaw lines chances\nare you're also going to have lower\nlevels of facial asymmetry which is a\ntopic we've covered in this video\nwith that being said if you'd like to\nlearn more about your top 10

"assistant", "content": "in this Tick Tock video we witnessed the\ntypical reaction of the shy individual\nwhen suddenly faced with someone that\nthey find attractive a runaway reflex\nlet's explore the reasons for this type\nof behavior some people particularly shy\nindividuals experience anxiety after\nencountering someone that they find\nattractive why do we do this and how\ndoes it affect our social interactions\nand perceived attractiveness begin with\nlet's try to understand the causes of\nnervousness in situations character and\npersonality are crucial in determining\nfeelings and Sensations when\nencountering someone attractive by\nindividuals can experience somatic\neffects such as sweating or trembling or\ncognitive effects like fears of judgment\nor reaction and behavioral effects such\nas avoiding encounters or avoiding eye\ncontact this happens because shy\nindividuals often have negative\nself-evaluations which it enhanced when\nthey come across somebody they perceive\nas quote unquote Superior of having a\nsuperior self-evaluation attractiveness\nis a common aspect for making these\ntypes of comparisons and research has\nshown that it is actually a associated\nwith the sense of superiority\nconsequently shy individuals become even\nmore intimidated when exposed to\nattractive individuals this intensifies\ntheir anxiety leading to the avoidance\nof social situations due to the fear of\nbeing judged by others and that would\nexplain why the girl in The Tick Tock\nvideo runs away but then the question\nbecomes do these effects have a\npsychological or physiological basis an\ninteresting paper by zoo and colleagues\ndemonstrated that shy individuals\nexhibit measurable brain signals when\nthey encounter someone that's highly\nattractive in anxiety-inducing context\nlike public speaking for example imagine\nthat you have to give a presentation in\nfront of the class and the attractive\nguy or girl in class decides to show up\nthat day this confirms that exposure to\nattractive individuals in stressful\nsituations actually triggers a signal in\nthe brain which in extreme cases can\nlead to responses such as running away\nseveral studies have demonstrated that\nindividuals perceive potential mates as\nmore attractive when they are actually\nunder stress on the flip side Susan\nhoogs and colleagues found that when an\nattractive potential partner looks\nnervous their nervousness actually\nenhances their attractiveness in other\nwords the awkward reactions you show to\nan individual you're interested in may\nmake you appear more endearing or\nattractive if considering you're already\nan attractive person this is an\ninteresting upside for shy individuals\nwho do happen to be attractive what\nabout extroverted individuals though you\nmay ask well do they have that same\nadvantage and research does show that\nindividuals who possess higher levels of\nagreeableness and extroversion are often\nconsidered more attractive it supports a\nstereotype that positive social traits\nalign with attractiveness in addition\nextroverts make conscious efforts to\nlook more appealing to others thereby\nenhancing the likelihood of social\ninteractions for this purpose they tend\nto smile more often maintain a\nwell-groomed appearance and generally be\nlikable in likable behaviors on the\nother hand shy individuals tend to avoid\nsocial interactions and are less\nproactive to modifying their appearance\nfor the sake of pleasing others so if\nextroverts are considered more\nattractive and have higher success in\nsocial interactions does that mean that\nintroverts are doomed well not\nnecessarily there seems to be some\nadaptive reasons behind somebody's shy\nBehavior at first glance it might appear\nthat displaying nervousness and\nawkwardness during an encounter with an\nattractive individual can hinder them\nmating success if one person is nervous\nwhile the other one is not it could\nindicate a mismatch in perceived mate\nvalue moreover individuals with higher\nself-perceived made value tend to be\nmore confident in their ability to\nattract a mate resulting in less\nnervousness and more flirtatiousness\nthis is because they are aware that\ntheir advances are typically well\nreceived making them less fearful of\nrejection however nervous reactions can\nactually signal interest which is\ncrucial in mating interactions as well\nresearch also suggests that when someone\nis aware that the other person is\nattracted to them it increases their own\nattraction towards that person up to a\nlemon of course in other words\ndisplaying nervousness does convey an\nhonest signal of Interest which can also\nincrease interest in return considering\nyou're similarly matched in terms of\nlooks this is why flirting can often\nsound awkward but it can also be quite\nbeneficial wherever certain aspects of\ncommunication improve under stress for\ninstance communication word rate so the\nwords per minute actually increases\nproductive language improves and the use\nof non-fluencies such as hmm and ums\nactually decreases this means that when\na person becomes anxious their\ncommunication becomes more effective as\nlong as they don't run away like in The\nTick Tock video which does also improve\ntheir chances of success there are some\nadaptive reasons for being generally\nnervous nervousness can also convey\nother desirable features in an encounter\nstudies indicate that anxious\nindividuals are perceived as nicer more\ninteresting and more engaging in\nconversation which enhances their\ndesirability in addition displaying\nnervous reactions indicates to a\npotential partner that the person\npossesses desirable personality traits\nfor a long-term relationship such as\nparenting being sensitive caring\nresponsive and empathetic to other\npeople and finally nervousness is also a\nform of expressiveness and research does\nshow that expressiveness is an\nattractive feature in fact non-verbal\nexpressiveness could also compensate for\na lack of physical attractiveness and\nmake a person appear more desirable so\nnervousness May initially seem like an\nobstacle to social relationships but\nthere is a reason why we have adapted\nand developed this behavioral trait for\nimproving our chances of social\ninteraction these behaviors may appear\nawkward and clumsy at times and can\nactually convey honesty interest and\ndesirable personality traits if done\ncorrectly in addition shy individuals\nare often perceived as more engaging and\nattractive if they are already of a\nreasonable level of attractiveness\noverall there is research to support\nboth personality types having positive\neffects and attraction and it really\ndoes depend on the context I'll be\ntalking long term or short-term mating\nvariables and this does also vary from\nperson to person the answer isn't as\nsimple as just saying that extroverted\npeople are more attractive because the\nbenefits of extroverted versus\nintroverted personality types seems to\nvary also depending on the person's own\nphysical level of attractiveness so\ndepending on your own attractiveness you\nmay benefit from being a more\nextroverted person or a more introverted\nperson as we just explained and so with\nthat being said if you'd like to learn\nmore about your own physical attractive\nas your own face your own features have\nan assessment performed in great detail\nand depth from the scientific literature\nby our team of doctors and dentists head\nover to the cruise website to get a\nfacial assessment performed and as\nalways I'll catch you all in the next\none"}]}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "we decided to photoshop some\nquote-unquote average looking\ncelebrities to be more conventionally\nattractive or more correctly model-esque\nand when we say average would it really\nmean unattractive it's just that they're\nnot typically top models so in this\nvideo we'll try to explain some of the\nthought processes behind what facial\nfeatures are being changed and in simple\nterms what are we changing to make\npeople look more attractive we'll see\nthat there are General facial\ncharacteristics that are more or less\nuniversally attractive which we often\nrefer to as universal beauty standards\nevery face is unique so it will be quite\ninteresting to see that the changes we\nmake are also quite uniquely catered to\nget the overarching idea you'll want to\nknow the four main parts of an\nattractive face as defined by nanyatal\nwhich is facial averageness or appearing\nnormal free of deformities or scars\nfacial dimorphism how masculine or\nfeminine you are symmetry which we all\nknow and proportion is also pretty\nstraightforward with many videos that go\nmore in depth in each of these but let's\ntry to keep them in mind throughout the\nvideo so let's go into the liquify tool\ntool and put these Concepts to the test\nand keep in mind there is nothing wrong\nwith any of these faces we're just\napplying the scientific literature on\nthe topic and trying to show what a\ncosmetic surgeon might be thinking\nduring the planning stage let's see what\nchanges we can make to Constance Wu's\nface she already has an attractive bass\nline to work with but we can make a few\nchanges we want to First note that her\nintercancel distance or the distance\nbetween her eyes is actually quite large\nthis is actually more common among East\nAsian populations according to Sana atal\nas well as other researchers on the\ntopic so it isn't really something we\nwant to drastically alter because it is\npart of her ethnic characteristic\naccordingly we can make our eyes larger\nor move her eyes closer together let's\nmake her eyes larger as that and this is\nalso a traditionally feminizing facial\nfeature often emphasized in eastern\nBeauty culture so despite being a ethnic\ncharacteristic it is something that a\nlot of people still do get changed\nConstance has some eye asymmetry here\nand we can also make one eye slightly\nless large to enhance the the balance\nand symmetry of both of them depending\non what kind of beauty standard we are\ntrying to emulate the east or the West\nconstants could have a more angular jaw\nand if we're referencing Western\nstandards that would be more appropriate\nsince she is well known for her roles in\nwestern films will give her a more\nprominent jawline but not overdoing it\nwe can also Contour her chin to be a bit\nmore angular and yet still feminine and\nv-shaped we can also accentuate the\nprotrusion of her cheekbones to be more\nprominent and high near the eyes and\nthis is the classic High fashion look\nthat is sought after through surgery but\noften seems to go wrong this is because\nwe don't want to over emphasize how\nprominent the cheekbones are forwardly\nbut rather make them look more defined\nand high in the lateral direction are\nanother Universal Beauty standard\nespecially for women because they signal\nhigh estrogen in development and also\nthey're a characteristic of strong\nDental facial growth but most\nimportantly they just add lift and\nglamor to the face by making the eyes\nappear more well protected Constance\nalso seems to have prominent nasolabial\nFalls so we can eliminate that with the\nhealing brush we can also slightly\nreduce the height of her chin to be more\nfeminine as well as giving her a shorter\nface shape both of these will make the\nface look more attractive if not\noverdone and one note on wrinkles is\nthat we generally don't want to remove\nall of the wrinkles of the face there\nare some wrinkles that actually add\nrefinement but there are some others\nthat have negative stereotypes with them\nin regards to a hairline constants has a\ngreat feminine hairline that is also\nrounded and juvenile in shape so we're\nnot going to change that either we can\nalso use the same Dodge and burn\ntechnique to add more contouring around\nthe cheekbones and jaw and the end\nresult should be in theory a more\nattractive version of the same face but\nwe'll leave that up to you to decide the\nidea here is again this isn't the\ntheoretically most attractive because\nthe theoretically most attractive would\nbe actually be toning down some of these\nchanges to be closer to her original\nface this would be more of the idealized\nstandards that we see in the modeling\nWorld which is not something we actually\nfollow for real people on that note if\nwe want to make her look less warm and\napproachable like you would see with a\nTop Model can decrease the contrast In\nHer Eyes by giving her lighter eyes but\nit also doesn't really affect her\noverall Beauty as we've covered in the\npast the brown Knight effect has a\nImprovement in trust while blue eyes do\nhave a decrease in the trustworthiness\nof the face if you want to make her look\nmore alluring or assertive we can also\nposition her eyebrows lower in Photoshop\nas well and her hair is also a strong\npoint so we can't really improve the\nstyling at all let's Photoshop Maya Hawk\nfrom stranger things some things you\ndon't want to change are her incredibly\nhigh and defined cheekbones you can see\nhow they pop just around the eyes Maya\nalso has a feminine and rounded hairline\nmuch like Constance and she already has\nhigh quality Health markers in clear\nskin and healthy hair so we don't need\nto change much of that texturing either\nMaya's eyes are well proportioned which\nfalls in line with the concept of\naverageness making her eyes look\nPleasant her lips are also quite full\nand shapely which is desirable for women\nand her nose shouldn't really warrant\nany changing either however the first\nfirst thing that we can change about the\nface is Maya's palpable slant or\nbasically how upturned the eyes are her\neyes aren't droopy by any means and her\nhead position can certainly affect how\nthe eyes look but generally more\nupturned eyes are considered attractive\nin women according to Quan a tall study\nnext she has a bit of a longer face\nshape why it does a great job of using\nFuller wider hairstyles to give the\nillusion of a more compact face shape to\nmake her face slightly shorter we can\nsubtly reduce her chin and forehead\nheight Maya already has white balanced\nfacial dirt but in the after her thirds\nare nearly identical so her forehead is\nthe same length as her lower anterior\nfacial height and the mid face as you\ncan see here Maya has some quite wide\ncheekbones which makes her jaw with look\na bit narrower by proportion the jaw is\nnot extremely narrow but we can add a\nsubtle amount of width to better\nharmonize with their face shape a narrow\njaw is actually a feminine facial\nfeature according to liver Russia at all\nso that does help boost her\nattractiveness but we can also make the\nJaws slightly wider so that it doesn't\ndetract from the femininity while also\naligning with the concept of averageness\nor a normal jaw width that you would\nexpect to see on a woman we can also\nchange her jawline to be more defined\nlike the previous faces and again this\nis just a universal attractive trait\nbecause it's an indication of healthy\nDental facial development after all of\nthese changes we can make some final\ntweaks in something like bass app where\nface app is just going to accentuate\nsome of the feminine features we covered\npreviously and it will also increase the\ncontrast around their eyes to look more\nsexy like we discussed in our video of\nwhat makes a face sexy versus beautiful\nface up also adds some shadows and\ncontouring like we did for the other\nfaces but much through Photoshop mind\nyou and the specific changes are very\nsubtle but they collectively add up to\nmake a more attractive face Maya's\noriginal hair color works well for her\nface as too dark of a hair color does\nclash with Pharaoh's skin and browse and\nbecomes more of a fashion statement and\nso with hair color it's really\nnegligible unless it is deliberately\ndark the sake of being contrasting let's\nPhotoshop Steve Carell to be more\nattractive it doesn't have the most\nremarkable striking facial features and\nhe also has some distinct signs of aging\nespecially around the eyes still he's\nbeen aging well into his 50s and now\neven the 60s and he is arguably getting\nbetter looking so first off we can make\nhis bone structure more robust or\nprominent by giving him a taller ramus\nthereby enhancing his jaw angle and\ndefinition can also improve the\ndefinition around his chin and\ncheekbones who can also make his\neyebrows more upturned and alert because\nhe looks very kind and friendly without\nthem and most fashion models have\nstriking and dominant facial features as\nyou can see here Steve has some apparent\neye asymmetry where one eye is lower\nthan the other but that won't really be\nnoticeable in Photoshop while retaining\nthe same eye shape Steve actually has a\nwide facial structure which is\nconsidered usually attractive for most\nmen and is commonly also seen in the\nmodeling industry however his thin lips\nact to lengthen the mid face and just\ndistract from how commanding the face\nappears this is an example of where thin\nlips being masculine actually don't make\nhim more attractive in simple speak\nbeing more masculine or feminine\nappearing will make you arguably more\nattractive up to a limit but there are\ncertain features where it doesn't\nexactly work Steve has a great hairline\nfor his age and even compared to guys 20\nyears younger his forehead balances with\nhis other facial turds so we don't\nreally need to change much there either\nwe don't want to remove all of his fine\nlines and wrinkles as he is an older\ngentleman so he gives him a more refined\nlook we do however want to remove the\nlabia mental creasing around the chin\nwhich is typically not considered\nattractive this will make his jawline\narguably look a lot better too through a\ntechnique called Dodge and burn in\nPhotoshop we can add some shadow and\ndefinitions around his cheekbones and\njawline to really give it that popping\nface up look we can also slightly darken\nhis eyebrows which is a very sexually\ndimorphic and masculine feature that\nalso looks more youthful and virile of\ncourse there are many other things we\ncan change but hopefully you should\nbegin to see a appreciable difference in\nthe features of an attractive and less\nattractive face and Steve's dentofacial\ngrowth or his jaw structure is a lot\nmore prominent and defined which is a\nuniversal Beauty standard because it\nindicates dentofacial Health gonka atal\nhighlights the importance of your facial\nstructure you know your cheekbones teeth\njawline for attractiveness and also for\nmaking First Impressions and his lips\nare also quite thin which goes against\nthe notion of averageness where\ndrastically changing very thin lips in\nPhotoshop is not really possible if you\nwant it to look natural but we can add a\nlittle bit of lip volume we can however\ngo into face app to make the lips look\nfuller but also modify them in Photoshop\nto look more natural lastly we can make\nSteve's nose a bit Slimmer and less bomb\nus to add Harmony to his face bringing\nback the proportion to being within his\nIris distances his nose is very\ncharacteristic and large and by no means\nis it a bad nose but suddenly changing\nthe width and height can make it look a\nbit better proportioned for his specific\nface let's make some final adjustments\nso his jawline doesn't look razor sharp\nand that should be more or less it Steve\nhas great hair that works for his face\nshape so we don't really need to alter\nhis hairstyle much it now starts to sort\nof resemble somebody like Bush and Bale\nbut mostly around the eyes if we really\nwant to change his eye color you can\ndecide which one he looks better with\nand it doesn't really look like Steve\nCarell anymore instead of playing\ncomedic roles like Michael in the office\nhe'd probably be taking Tom Cruise's\nleading man roles this isn't to say that\nthis is the most attractive face\npossible in theory the most attractive\nface would actually be toning down these\nchanges a little and just doing a bit\nmore from Steve's original face but not\ntoo much like we've done here but it is\nan improvement that demonstrates the\nextremes of Western modeling bone\nstructure even the vast majority of\nmodels don't have a jawline this large\nand angular since these kind of videos\ntake a lot of time in planning\nespecially if you want to show you the\nprocess and not just face up it and show\nyou the result we could only fit three\nfaces in this video and so if you want\nto see more suggest any others you'd\nlike to see in the future perhaps we can\nturn this into a series as always if you\nwant your face analyzed much like we did\nit here but with a lot more detail and\nrigorous scientific methods by a team of\ndoctors and dentists head over to the\ncoup's website you can have your own\nanalysis if you want to change the way\nyou look or change Aesthetics or perhaps\nimprove head over to the Google's\nwebsite and as always I'll catch you in\nthe next one"}]}

Effect"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "foreign\n[Music]\nlike every time being bold is brought up\nJason Statham's name somehow makes its\nway into the conversation he is the\nfirst person people point to as the\nParagon or the perfect example of an\nattractive bald man but the thing is\nyou're not Jason Statham and we really\nneed to break down why is it that he is\none of the few people that can pull off\nthe Bold look and the average person\ncan't is it true that he looks better\nwithout him how does his lack of hair\naffect his facial attractiveness and\nwhat if he actually looks better with\nher we've just seen him without hair for\nso long these are the questions that\nnobody asked for but we have to answer\nanyway in this video we've Enlisted the\nhelp of Dr Gary Link of himself expert\ncosmetic surgeon to give us some advice\non what we think has changed here if you\nlike our content you certainly love his\nas well we'll even take a look at some\nphotoshops of Jason with hair to prove\nif hair actually makes a difference and\njust like in past celebrity analysis\nvideos we'll also get into some of the\nscience behind Jason's facial structures\nfeatures and the psychology of beauty\nit's worth mentioning that Jason's\non-screen persona May contribute to his\nperceived masculinity and his ability to\npull off the Bold look usually just\nplays variations of the tough guy that\nis cool Under Pressure I mean just look\nat the last Fast and Furious series but\nstill he has a caring side he basically\njust plays himself like a lot of actors\ndo though he does do a very convincing\njob of playing the tough guy and he\nundoubtedly gets Typecast for this role\nhis athletic build and masculine\nfeatures do help to add believability to\nthe casting you see Jason's ability to\npull off a bold look has a lot to do\nwith his facial dimorphism or the\nmasculinity of his face when we\nPhotoshop his face to be more feminine\nand less dominant his lack of hair now\nappears incongruent to his overall look\nand so the boldness of the head and the\nappearance of the face have a\ncorrelation where we assume that a bad\nguy or a villain must be dominant\naggressive perhaps also capable and\nthese all come with highly masculinized\nfaces because masculinity is often tied\nto both the good and negative aspects of\nit and so specifically in the Western\nHemisphere we associate boldness with\nmasculinity because women do not suffer\nfrom pattern baldness at the same rates\nthat men do being bold almost signals to\nothers that you are a man with DHT the\ntestosterone derivative that causes head\nhair to miniaturize but if you don't\nhave the powerful jaw the brow Ridge the\nfacial hair to match all the other\nmasculine facial signals then it just\nappears incongruent you have the\nmasculinity in the hair or the lack of\nhair not anywhere else and in that case\nthe lack of hair could appear to be due\nto any number of reasons like alopecia\nareata which is an autoimmune disease\nand so very simply to answer the\nquestion in Jason's case is masculine\nfacial proportions and features\ncorrespond well to his lack of hair if\nyou were to take any hyper masculine man\nand make the Bold then generally there\nwould be a degree of Harmony that works\nwith the hairstyle\nso naturally we now have to ask what\nmakes Jason space masculine the first\nand most obvious masculinizing feature\nis Jason's Den spatial hair he has no\npatchiness to the bed which increases\nthe perceived attractiveness and\nmasculinity in line with the studies\nfrom Dixon and rantala he also has a\nprominent brow Ridge which is among the\nmost identifiably masculine facial\nfeatures along with his jaw size and the\nrobustness of his mid face according to\nleotal similarly his chin is more\nprojected than average in the front view\nand his chin is both tall and\nhorizontally wide new features that are\nalso again masculinizing according to\nThornhill and gangstad in fact Jason\nseems to hit all of the markers of a\nface that is developed with a high ratio\nof testosterone estrogen and he even has\nthin lips and narrow Eyes On Top of the\nmasculinizing features we just mentioned\nhe is the prototypical masculinized face\nwhich is why he's one of the few faces\nthat can really pull off the look Jason\nStatham's face doesn't really fit into\nall of the proportional ideals that are\nlaid out in scientific literature that\nreally isn't the strong point of the\nface however that doesn't mean he has a\nface with poor proportions\ninstead of only focusing on the pleasant\nlet's briefly touch on what proportions\ngive Jason a unique look that goes away\nfrom the average most of his unique\nfeatures has to do with exaggerated\ndrawer size and the forehead height\noverall we can see that Jason's lower\nthird occupies a large portion of his\nface interestingly it actually seems to\nhelp create balance in his face due to\nits high hairline if his jaw was shorter\nperhaps his hairline recession would\nlook relatively worse because now the\nbalance would be lost so that's not to\nsay that Jason's increased lower third\nhigh is conventionally attractive a\npaper in the European Journal of\nOrthodontics by arcoubertal said that\nclass 1 Normal teeth alignment male\nprofiles with normal lower facial height\nwere the most attractive the profiles\nwere less attractive with increased\nlower third height and Class 2 or class\n3 occlusions which are basically under\nbites and overbite so basically more or\nless in Jason's case the increased lower\nthird height wouldn't typically do him\nany benefits if the situation was\ndifferent other research also agrees\nthat a normal jaw height is the most\nattractive in a male face in Mr\nStadium's case we cannot say for sure if\nhe has a jaw misalignment without seeing\na x-ray so his soft tissue profile is\nvirtually completely flat indicated by\nthe 180 degrees of facial convexity most\nof his other lateral facial assessments\nalso shows some kind of disharmony\nbetween his lower jaw the upper jaw the\nnose and the glabella protrusion which\nis the base of the forehead if that\nsounds confusing basically Jason doesn't\nfit the conventional mold of perfect\ninterfacial structure like an\northodontist would Define it and that\nwould be comparing Jason to someone like\nHenry Cavill who has much better\northodontic structure we could attribute\nsome of that to his prominent chin and\nthe brow Ridge reducing the chin and the\nbrow Ridge protrusion slightly in\nPhotoshop changes nothing regarding his\nteeth alignment but it does give him a\nprofile that fits more of the convex or\nthe slightly rounded ideal we see in\nmost humans so Jason probably doesn't\nhave a severe underbite or anything like\nthat and in that sense he does fit\nUniversal standards of beauty with they\nhealthy and functional jaw the only\nnotably negative thing a dentist or a\nclinician might point out is that his\nincreased jaw height adds a level of\ndisproportion to the face that is just\none feature and if anything it actually\nbalances out lack of hair\nand so with that example hopefully you\ncan appreciate that there is no such\nthing as a good or bad facial feature\nthey're just facial features but there\nis such thing as good and bad Harmony\nwhich is the relationship of facial\nfeatures and so per some of the\nproportions that Laura tell uses in\ntheir study we can form an ideal CGI\nfemale face and then we can compare the\nvertical height of his jaw to things\nlike his nose height and other facial\nturds to get a better idea of just how\ntall his jaw is the height of his nose\nis only 61 of his total anterior lower\nthird height that is almost half the\nheight of his jaw visually we can see\nhow short his nose is but for\ncuriosity's sake let's compare his ratio\nwith male model Sean O'Pry as an example\nof a face with more balance his ratio is\nabout point a meaning his nose is not\nnearly as short similarly we can compare\nthe relative Heights of Jason's facial\ndirt being bald exacerbates the\nappearance of a tall upper third\nspecially if you already have a longer\nshaped face like Jason like we mentioned\nhis lower third height seems to balance\nwith his opposite good but his middle\nthird and his nasal regions are\ndisproportionately compact this detracts\nfrom facial averageness or normality but\nit does give him an incredibly\nmasculinized and dimorphic appearance\nlet's also touch on some of the\npositives in terms of Jason's facial\nHarmony Jason has a favorable gonial\nangle or the jaw angle of 115 degrees\nwhich gives them a more masculine robust\nappearance but nothing overly squared or\nrounded depending on the paper some\nresearchers note that there is no\nsignificant difference in the male and\nfemale Jewel angle While others point to\na more acute and square jaw angle being\nthe preferred masculine ideal without\ngetting too pedantic about numbers or\nspecific angles we know that facial\naverageness or normality is what makes a\nface look attractive as long as Jason's\njaw is not too round or resembling a\nMinecraft face it will look attractive\nand the same goes for the most of you\nsafe to say Jason is right in that\nharmonious Middle Ground his nose also\ndoes not appear to upturn or droopy with\na pleasant nasolabial angle of 109\ndegrees according to the ranges set out\nin one paper by gumerous atal in the\nfront his nose has some ruggedness\naround the dorsum with the same comment\nabout his nose not being too upturned or\ndroopy still does apply another\nprominent facial feature is Jason's high\ncheekbones you could clearly identify\nthe protrusion of the OG curve near his\neyes the OG curve is this imaginary line\nwithdrawal that shows the shape of the\ncheekbone in the three-quarter profile\nand it's very apparent from this view to\nsum up Jason is a unique case of facial\nfeatures while he may not possess the\nmost researched ideals in facial\nproportions and angles they work for a\nspecific phase because what he lacks in\none field he makes up for being extreme\nin another is large jaw helps create\nbalance with his high hairline allowing\nhim to pull off being bald his prominent\nchin while mathematically too prominent\ndoes add a lot of sexual dimorphism to\nhis face and to put is simply his face\nsacrifices facial averageness to\nexaggerate masculine facial features\nlike his chin size but here's the real\nmillion dollar question does Jason look\nbetter with or without hair in the past\nwe've looked at a paper by Thomas cash\nand they noted how male pattern baldness\ngenerally causes less favorable initial\nImpressions including lower ratings of\nphysical attractiveness judgments of\nless desirable personal and\ninterpersonal characteristics and\nmisperceptions of age though the\nstrength of the boldness stereotype was\nreduced when we controlled for facial\nattractiveness and simply put if you put\nan attractive bald man like Jason next\nto an average man with hair the social\njudgments would probably favor Jason\nthe reason Jason can pull off being bold\nwithout the negative social judgment is\nunsurprisingly because he is\nconventionally attractive if we make his\nface less attractive in Photoshop then\nall of a sudden that same hairline is\nperceived differently it fits most of\nthe standards that beauty researchers\nlike Rhodes 90 and others have\nrepeatedly discussed facial averageness\ndimorphism proportions and Symmetry and\nit was even a catalog model in the 90s\nhe's not a top male model but he does\nfit a lot of universal and also Western\nspecific beauty standards for men and\nit's reasonable to assume that Jason\nwould have looked better with hair but\nhe still pulls off the board look well\nbecause of the factors that we mentioned\nhis face isn't attractive primarily due\nto his hair instead his facial structure\nlow body fat and facial angularity which\ngives him a dimorphic and attractive\nappearance even as he gets older\nwe can see that at a higher body fat\npercentage Jason loses some of that\nfacial robusticity or the sharpness of\nhis face the masculinity and the general\nattractiveness would suffer more\nnegative perceptions related to his hair\nloss now instead of being a ripped\nA-list actor he looks like a typical\nbuff dad at the beach\ntake a look at these photos of Jason\nwith different hairstyles not every\nhairstyle suits his face but the ones\nthat do arguably make him look more\nyouthful and attractive longer more\nboyish hairstyles don't appear to\nharmonize with his harsher more\nmasculine features such as the torch in\nthe low brow the Johnny Depp example is\none such place that can pull off those\nhairstyles even into his 50s but Jason\nprobably wouldn't be able to it's also\narguably the case that Jason tends to\nlook better if his hair is less grown\nout and this lessens the blatant\nappearance of the hairline recession\nultimately men and women alike prefer\ndifferent hairstyles and different faces\nso there is no definitive answer but the\nJson looks better bald with hair it's\nperfectly reasonable to argue that Jason\nlooks more confident and commanding\nwithout the hair but the more look gives\nhim an air of authority and makes him\nappear more dominant which is perfect\nfor his roles as an action hero the\nboard look is also lighter and low\nmaintenance which is what you would\nexpect for a military hardened character\nthat Jason often plays\nbut you see Jason was quite an\ninteresting face to look at and with a\nlot of disagreement as to what works and\nwhat doesn't work with his face so we\nwanted to hear it from an expert in hair\nDr Gary Lincoln from City facial\nPlastics thanks curve studio for having\nme on your channel when I look at Jason\nStatham he has clear signs of\nandrogenetic alopecia or what most\npeople call it male pattern baldness at\nthis point it looks like he's a Norwood\nclass six or seven so he definitely is\nmore advanced on the Norwood Hamilton\nscale now before we jump into hair\nrestoration options it's important to\ndiscuss prevention it's always better to\nprevent hair loss before it's too late\nand the first line medical therapy that\nallows us to prevent hair loss in man is\nfinasteride finasteride reduces DHT\nlevels and that slows down the\nminiaturization process that leads to\nhair loss now as far as treating the\nhair loss the medical therapy that I\nlike to add two finasteride is minoxidil\nin its oral form that helps with\nincreasing the antigen or the growth\nphase of the hair cycle and creates\nFuller and longer hair follicles and\nthat increases the diameter and the\nlength of the hair shafts it's easy to\nobtain both oral minoxidil and oral\nfinasteride at feel confident.com other\nmedical therapy options that I consider\nsecondary would be PRP or platelet-rich\nplasma low-level laser light therapy and\nmicroneedling as far as treatment goes\neven though this is not a surgical or\nmedical therapy I think it's a good\noption for some patients it's called\nscalp micropigmentation scalp\nmicropigmentation involves laying down\nink in little dots that then mimics the\nappearance of hair some people choose to\ndo micropigmentation on a bald scalp\nWhile others do it in an area where\nthere already is hair but where the\ndensity isn't as great as they would\nlike and lastly of course there's the\npotential for a hair transplant\nprocedure now if Jason was interested in\na hair transplant surgery the option\nthat I would go with as far as\nharvesting the hair would be Fue or\nfollicular unit extraction and that's\nbecause of how short he wears his hair\nwe want to avoid a linear scar on the\nback of his head which is what fut would\nprovide as far as graph count I would go\nwith an initial surgery of about 2500\ngrafts and I would implant these graphs\ninto the frontal scalp sometimes we talk\nabout improving the temples as well and\nrebuilding the hairline to include the\ntemples and the frontal Temple area into\nthe central hairline however the temples\ncan consume a large number of graphs so\nwhen those graphs are needed at the\nfrontal scalp midscalp or crown will\nusually avoid implanting grafts into the\ntemple so this is true when there's a\nlarge recipient area and a limited donor\narea then let's say Jason Statham has a\nnice result from the initial surgery\nthen we would consider a secondary\nsurgery that would bring say another\n2500 graphs to then the mid scalp and\npotentially the crown as well and that\nwould give him overall nice coverage to\nthe areas that have lost hair now of\ncourse the donor area will be more\ndepleted but it should still look\npresentable for actors especially it's\nimportant to stay conservative with\nsurgical procedures it'll limit the\nobvious change that occurs with surgery\nit's also important to not be overly\naggressive with repositioning the\nhairline and dropping it too low because\nif you have thinning behind that\nhairline it's going to look artificial\nbut undergoing hair restoration is very\nmuch a personal choice and some people\nwould rather be bald and Jason looks\ngreat with his short hairstyle and with\nthat being said a huge thank you to Dr\nLincoln for the very important\nscientific discussion of Jason Statham's\nhairline needless to say you should all\ncheck out his channel where a big fan of\nhis work and if you'd like to get your\nface and facial

"content": "I'm honestly still shocked by Mega\nMarco's transformation not sure if she\nhad surgery or what her chin definitely\nlooks enhanced but this is her just a\nfew weeks ago introducing a friend of\nhers at a TED\n[Music]\ntalk so what's happened to Megan marle\nhas she had surgery to seemingly change\nher face this much Megan herself is\nactually no stranger to the spotlight\nbut her recent look has certainly\nsparked some controversy could it just\nbe the lighting angles and makeup like\nsome people are speculating well that\ncould be the case but let's try to\nanalyze the face to find out if there's\nany structural changes which may\nindicate surgery or filler so when we're\ntrying to break down if Megan has had\nanything done surgically and there's\nnothing wrong with that we really have\nto be very particular with her exact\nfacial morphological changes basically\nshape related changes this could be\nchanges in her jaw shape eyebrow\nposition or things of that nature it\nisn't enough to Simply say she looks\ndifferent so she must have had surgery\nbecause there has to be some kind of\njustification for why you think so it\nalso wouldn't be very fair to herself\nwhere this could actually be reasonably\nachieved with just non-cosmetic\nSolutions it is understandable to think\ncelebrities with a lot of wealth at\ntheir disposal would go under the knife\nbut we do need a little bit more than\nthat to back the claim some changes are\nsimply achievable through lighting and\nmakeup and you'd be surprised what the\nworld's top artists can do given enough\ntime to change the Face's appearance\nwith that being said there's certainly\nmore than just makeup to Megan's face so\nlet's dive into that Megan has always\nhad an impeccable facial structure that\nhas not changed more specifically she\nhas always had a very strong robust\njawline her jaw is wide which can be\nslightly masculinizing but it actually\nbalances with her more obtuse with the\nwider gonal angle which is feminizing we\ndon't really see any distinct\nmorphological changes to her jaw\nstructure in that regard some people\nhave pointed out her chin being larger\nwhich at first glance does appear to be\ntrue however camera Distortion can alter\nthe relative proportions of the face she\nis also smiling which can jut the chin a\nbit forward and downwards and in older\nphotos she also has a relatively tall\nchin the only distinct change we can\nperhaps point out is that her chin has\ntaken on a more of a u-shape rather than\na v-shape in other words it is slightly\nwider and more prominent this type of\nchin shape is actually not really a\nfavorable trait for women since wider\nchins are more of a male dimorphic trait\nand so it is unlikely her surgeon would\nhave been on board with this as she\nalready had a well contoured and defined\nchin beforehand you may notice how her\neyes look a bit further apart and even\nher forehead looks taller overall her\nface looks slightly more elongated and\ndistorted in that controversial photo so\nit is likely that she is just close to\nthe camera and the lens Distortion is\ncausing some of the changes to the\nfacial proportions interestingly enough\nMegan isn't a stranger to improving her\nappearance just like any actress she has\na midline misalignment where the middle\ngap of her tooth is actually slightly\noff center compared to a lower teeth Tom\nCruz famously had this exact same same\nthing and people often did unfortunately\npoke fun at it as looking off just like\nTom her smile improved a lot from when\nshe was younger when she was a lot\nyounger she had a notable gap between\nher front teeth so it's very likely she\nunderwent some kind of orthodontic\ntreatment like braces or jaw surgery\nwithout getting technical into what kind\nof jaw misalignment she had when she was\nyounger the point is that she isn't a\nstranger to aesthetically improving her\nappearance and also her functional\nwell-being Megan has always had good\nteeth but now she has more standard or\nexemplary Smiles that patients try to\nemulate when Consulting the denti\naside from that we don't really see any\nother changes to her jawline throughout\nthe years she has lost some facial fat\nand as a result got in a more defined\nand sculpted jawline which comes with\nthe age but that's more or less about it\nso this is where we can potentially\nidentify any cosmetic surgical changes\nlet's try to break it down in different\nparts that could make up Megan's eyes to\nsee if anything stands out we're using\nthe eyes as the reference point because\nchanging the physical structure of the\neyes is very difficult and it's not\nsomething people would do for cosmetic\nreasons that being said her eyes do\nstill have the same distinct spacing\nbeing slightly closer set her eyes still\nretain the same upturn shape which can\nalso give a youthful and alert\nappearance and we also don't see any\nother the changes to her smaller almond\ney shape additionally Megan's upper\neyelid region still has the same subtle\nexposure but we can only see parts of\nher upper eyelid most clinicians agree\nthat superorbital fat tissue in other\nwords fat above the eye is expected to\ndiminish with age which is probably why\nwe can see more of her upper eyelid as\nshe gets older but some research by\nchangal actually notes that fat volume\nin women's brows increases with age\nwhile muscle decreases Swift atal paper\nalso notes how some people experience\ndrooping of the brow with age While\nothers experience brow elevation in\nMegan's case she is only 41 so it seems\nreasonable that her eyelid looks more\nexposed and prettier is because of the\nmakeup given the illusion of a higher\neyelid\ncrease we do however see really glaring\nchanges to the under eye region she\ndoesn't have the same dark circles that\nwe see in older photos and this could\njust be makeup or it could be likely\nthat she has got an inject under drve\nfiller for a more permanent solution and\nit's actually a lot more common than you\nwould think she would have to continue\ngetting this yearly so only time will\ntell if we see the dark circles worsen\nor we may never see them ever again her\neyes are also a slightly different color\nbut that could be more likely because of\nthe exposed lining and it's also\npossible that she could be wearing\nslightly colored\ncontacts another place that we can\nalmost definitely point out changes is\nin the brow shape it is quite subtle but\nthat is what most celebrities try to\nachieve the change can't be too drastic\nor people will most certainly notice she\nhyper aesthetically could have had an\nendoscopic brow lift to raise the outer\narch of her brow by 2 to 4 mm creating\nthe appearance of a more useful brow\nshape before she had a slight Arch but\nher brow was a bit heavier and arguably\nslightly downturned at the ends this can\ngive more of a worried or a tired\nappearance rather than alert and\nconfident additionally her eyebrows just\nappear to be positioned slightly higher\ngiving her a more neous and feminine\nappearance while it does seem to be true\nthat Megan had rhinoplasty when she was\nyounger to reduce the size and bulbous\nof her nasal tip and the dorsam width\nthe recent photos don't indicate any\ndrastic changes over the past few years\nthis time we can attribute this to\ncontouring around the nose to make it\nappear slimmer and more defined around\nthe tip and if she had any kind of\nrhinoplastic revision assuming she had a\nsurgery before then the nose really\nwould not retain its natural shape this\nwell Megan chebs also appear Fuller and\nmore defined as of the recent but it is\nhard to tell with her hair covering her\nface you could have just gotten\ncheekbone filler given the other changes\nthat we've listed but leave that up to\nyou to decide so to summarize this what\ncomes along with being a celebrity\nespecially British royalty is a lot of\nscrutiny on your appearance some of it\nis warranted and more obvious like\nPrince Harry's hair loss but is that\nalso the case for Megan Megan has likely\nhad some smaller scale operations to\nmaintain her youth like filler in the\ntea trough area so her eyes look less\nsunken and tired one of the more obvious\nand likely things that she may have had\ndone is dental work to improve her smile\nand lastly she looks to have had a brow\nlift to give her eyes are more youthful\nand alert appearance everything else\nlike her recent nose shape skin tone eye\ncolor and hair can actually just be\nattributed to makeup and stylistic\nchanges and so we can't say with any\nkind of certainty especially with no\nsigns of structural changes with that\nbeing said if you'd like to learn more\nabout your face much like we broke it\ndown here but with more detail and more\nNuance for your specific goals whether\nit be looking better getting

"content": "[Music]\nsmartphone face why do some people look\nmore modern than others what an\nabsolutely fascinating topic so this\narticle quotes this tweet here and the\nTweet says I think this is less about\ncostumes and more about the fact that\nthe cast of Almost Famous didn't have\nterminal I know what smartphones are\nface do you have what the internet is\ncalling the smartphone face this is the\nlatest for encirculating tick tock and\nvarious social media with other online\nPublications and apparently today's\nfaces look like they know what a\nsmartphone is which is just such a\nhilarious concert I love that but it\nsounds a bit odd on the surface and\nthere actually may be some deeper truth\nas we've done from our digging so let's\ncover that in this video as per an\narticle by Glam having a smartphone face\nmeans in simple terms having a more\nmodern looking face this is a face that\ncannot believably play in films set in\nthe Victorian era for example or even\nthe 1900s these faces look like they'd\nknow what an iPhone\nand the author notes how there is no\nsignificant difference between the faces\nof someone from the silent generation of\naround the 1930s and the Gen Z\ngeneration the facial diversity is still\nthere as a result of external factors\nrather than an evolutionary process\nbehavioral ecologist Michael Sheehan\ntells dazed the perceived differences in\nappearance of people between the mid\n20th century and now is almost certainly\nthe result of stylistic grooming or Diet\nchanges rather than facial Evolution\nthus a potential explanation for the\nsmartphone base just has to do with how\npeople style themselves Now versus in\nthe past that could be this different\nclothing the different hairstyles or\neven the modern application of cosmetic\nenhancement such as makeup however later\nin the video we're going to take a look\nat some other perspectives that say\nsmartphones are actually changing how\nthe modern face look explaining the\nsmartphone face may not just be as\nsimple as stylistic differences as we'll\ncover in just a second there may\nactually be two different ways of\nclassifying smartphone faces the first\ndescribes an attractive face that looks\nmodern link Emily radakowski Haley\nBieber or any Instagram model-esque face\nthat kind of face just doesn't look like\nit belongs in the 1961 version of West\nSide Story or just imagine Kylie Jenner\nKim Kardashian starring in the 1939\nWizard of Oz just wouldn't fit or\nimagine an Instagram male model or any\nfamous Tech talker in that 60s film like\nThe Godfather which is actually set in\nthe 40s crazy the second classification\nof the smartphone face is actually more\nclinical think of the mouth\nbreather-esque face with sagging jowls\nforward neck posture and overall weaker\nfacial structure that also seems to be a\nmodern phenomenon and most people are\ninterpreting the smartphone face in\neither of those two ways so far we've\npointed out some examples of smartphone\nfaces like Kim Kardashian Kylie Jenner\nso on and so forth by analyzing their\nfaces should glue us into what makes\nthis quote-unquote Smartphone face a\nlarge component of smartphone faces is\nfollowing modern beauty trends like\nveneers lining up your beard Tick Tock\nhairstyles shaping your brows getting a\nfade haircut or cosmetic surgery like\nlip fillers picture a male model with a\nperfectly trimmed beard groomed eyebrows\nthat type of high maintenance just\nwasn't emphasized as much as it is today\nI think you'd be willing to bet this guy\nknows what an iPhone is as well as Tick\nTock venmo Drake Taylor Swift and so\nforth women today Conjuring can be used\nto essentially fake the facelift you can\nmainly thank the Kardashians for\npopularizing that in the 1920s and 40s\ncontouring and other similarly cosmetic\nenhancements were getting more popular\nand integrated into daily life but\nnothing like we see today today the\nCosmetic industry amasses billions of\ndollars in revenue and as a result of\ncosmetic use all faces start to take on\na characteristically 2000 error face\nAdditionally the reason a lot of\ncelebrities and influences look so\nsimilar is because of surgery including\ncheap bone pillars lip fillers and Botox\nwhere Laura and genitalia who researches\nbeauty standards know how in the 70s\nactors had more facial expressions and a\nunique look if you look at pharah\nFawcett she has thin lips a high nose\nbridge and an angular jaw and she has a\nunique look with features that wouldn't\nbe popular by today's beauty standards\nnowadays if you don't have the full lips\nthe Slender knows the sharp jawline and\nfinely maintained eyebrows you won't fit\nin at least that applies in many\nsubcultures like in LA for example which\ndominate a lot of social media and the\nfaces that we're exposed to thus a\nsmartphone face will likely have Fuller\nlips in proportion to his or her chin\nand the filton region you'll also have a\nmore angular jaw more angular cheekbones\nas we tend to really emphasize those two\nthings nowadays more so than ever before\nlastly they will have more angular and\nlower bra shapes instead of the high and\nthinly arched brow as you would see in\nthe earlier years which were typically\nbefore smartphones existed we've also\ntaken a look at research by feza atoll\nin the past learning how today's youth\ntends to prefer browse in a lower\nposition while those above the 30s\nprefer the opposite it's also plausible\nthat nowadays the average person is more\nattractive simply due to the amount of\nhealthcare options available you can\ntreat teeth misalignment through braces\nor orthognathic surgery for example and\nthere is also just more correct\ninformation available on how to improve\nyour looks through getting in good shape\nand eating right so for fun let's take\nsome examples of smartphone faces test\nyourself and see whether or not you\nthink these would have more of a\nclassical face or more of the smartphone\nphase and there is no right or wrong\nanswer we're just trying to pull the\naudience let's look at Timothy\nCharlemagne I think you could argue he\nhas an old-timey face but at the same\ntime his features are just too chiseled\nand\nsmartphone-esque to convincingly play a\nking in the 15th century even though he\nhas played more archaic roles in the\npast it doesn't really fit the bill at\nleast in in our opinion does male model\nTyson Beckford have a smartphone face I\nthink this one is pretty obvious and I\nwould say it's definitely a smartphone\nface with the style as well as the trim\nstubble groomed eyebrows and Model S\nfacial structure okay what about Jenna\nOrtega does she know what a smartphone\nis I would say that her face does look\nquite modern and she certainly does know\nwhat an iPhone is actress gugu mavatha\nraw has played various old-timey roles\nin the past convincingly so and at the\nsame time she has that angular robust\ndual structure that is quite popular\ntoday quite a tricky one I would say yes\nthe Chinese actress Fang bing bing have\na smartphone face she has played a\nChinese Empress in a Past film role so\ncasting directors must have thought she\ncould convincingly do the job this I\nwould say she doesn't have the\nsmartphone face which Jean page is\nprobably a good example of the\nstereotypical smartphone face Ella\nRamsay was an example of people brought\nup when they're thinking of a\nnon-smartphone face and probably has to\ndo with the fact that she hasn't gotten\ncosmetic surgery such as fillers Botox\nEtc and she also doesn't have that\nstereotypical La model look nor is that\nthe type of roles that she typically\ngets cars for Harbor Megan Fox can the\nsame person have a smartphone face and a\nnon-smartphone face at the same time\nwell nowadays probably everyone would\nunanimously agree that she has a\nsmartphone face when she was younger you\nprobably still had the smartphone face\nbut it's definitely more debatable the\nlook was just more natural and less\nexaggerated with modern cosmetics and\nsurgery we took a look at the cultural\nside of things as well as some of the\nfacial morphological differences however\nthere is another perspective on the\nsmartphone face that some people are\narguing some people including doctors\nare attributing smartphone face to our\nphones actually changing the shape of\nher face namely the posture that we have\nwhen using an iPhone Insight the forward\nneck and slouchback to become more and\nmore common in that case a smartphone\nface may actually look more like this\nthat's not as attractive as the previous\nsmartphone faces right well this is\nbecause there is no right answer to what\na smartphone is in the basic sense it's\njust any face that looks modern both of\nthese takes are perfectly reasonable\napparently smartphone plus gravity\nequals sagging jowls double chins a\nlonger face and an overall undefined\njawline at least according to British\ncosmetic surgeon Dr Mervin Patterson now\nit is hard to say that if this is true\nwithout any kind of clinical data to\nback it up but it is an interesting note\nabout why our faces look different today\nDr Patterson justifies it by saying if\nyou sit for hours with your head bent\nslightly forward staring at your iPhone\nor laptop screen you're going to shorten\nthe neck muscles and increase the\ngravitational pull on the jowl area\nleading to a drooping jawline this\ndoctor is more so thinking of smartphone\nface as related to poor posture and\nunfavorable facial characteristics and\nthese features do make you look less\nattractive less beautiful aged and more\ncharacteristically mouth breathing there\nis actually some interesting research in\nthe Aesthetic Surgery Journal by Malia\ntal that discusses the role of gravity\nin periorbital or under eye and mid\nfacial aging the authors note that\ngravitational forces play an important\nrole in mid-face aging when lying down\nalso call this Supine position the signs\nof mid-face aging are less Stark this is\nbecause gravity isn't pulling down on\nyour mid face or assumedly even your jaw\nhow do most of us stare at our\nsmartphones our heads are tilted down\nand our neck is forward a physics buff\nwatching this could probably compare the\ngravitational forces of our facial\nstructure in poor versus upright\nposition and while the forces may be\nvery small in the micronutrons OR\nNewtons themselves they will have an\neffect over long periods of time but to\nclose this out of course something like\nthe smartphone face is just another\ntrendy catchphrase is really up for\ninterpretation if you think smartphone\nface represents something not covered in\nthis video and that's perfectly fine we\nwant to hear your thoughts is smartphone\nface the weak jaw definition or is it\nthe IG influencer look it's up to you or\nis there no such thing as a smartphone\nface and it's just a cultural and\nstyling difference with that being said\nif you would like to learn more about\nyour smartphone face how you look and\nmore realistically your facial\nencephalometric assessments and your\naesthetic facial looks and have with an\nassessment performed by a team of\ndoctors and dentists you can go over

about\nwhy people stare at you in public\nas we've discussed in other videos from\nan evolutionary perspective\nattractiveness provides cues related to\ngenetic quality of a potential bait\nattractive individuals are often\nperceived by others as healthier and\nalso being more successful sociable and\noverall much happier\nthis phenomenon is sometimes referred to\nas the beauty is good stereotype or the\nhalo effect in both the face and the\nbody can provide important cues where\nfor instance the body displays more\nfertility cues while the face is\nindicative of Health cues when we see a\nperson for the first time we quickly\nform an impression of them based on\ntheir physical appearance typically we\ngive more weight to facial beaches\nbecause the face provides unique\ninformation about a person's identity\nemotion behavior and other important\ncharacteristics that the body just\ndoesn't but why do we look at Attractive\npeople more so than unattractive people\nseems obvious but it's really not their\npaper titled can Beauty be ignored\nvexofacial attractiveness on Covert\nattention the author studied the\ndistracting effects of attractive faces\ninterestingly when an attractive face\nwas displayed on the periphery of the\nparticipants visual field the given task\ntook longer in other words the\nparticipants found it harder to perform\nthe task when there was an attractive\nface in their field of view even if the\nattention was not directly pointed\ntowards it the these results imply that\nattractive faces capture attention to\nsuch an extent that even the simpler\ntasks become more difficult Attractive\npeople are indeed hard to resist and\nanyone with social media can attest to\nhow distracting the process can be\nnot only does attractiveness capture\nattention but also non-attractiveness is\nlikely to have an aversive effect this\nwas demonstrated by mitrovic and\ncolleagues by showing participants\nscenes they included both attractive and\nunattractive individuals the authors\nwere able to determine that participants\nlooked longer and more often at the less\nattractive phase of their non-preferred\nsex than the less attractive face of\ntheir preferred sex in other words\nparticipants found less attractive faces\nof their preferred sex even less likable\nthan the less attractive faces of their\nnon-preferred sex this rejection of\nfaces of the preferred sex seems to show\nyou that attractive faces can cue\nfeelings of dislike but it mainly\napplies if you are attracted to say men\nfor example and you see another\nunattractive man\nand our proclivity to stare Attractive\npeople be clinically measured is there a\nreason for why we do this well in one\nstudy by Cloutier atel participants\nunderwent brain scans using magnetic\nresonance imaging wild were shown\nphotographs of faces who are also asked\nto evaluate the attractiveness of what\nthey were looking at and brain region\nassociated with reward on significant\nactivation when exposed to highly\nattractive faces again most people can\nrelate to this from experience\nespecially with the saturation of\nattractive faces on social media and pop\nculture these findings support the\nprevious idea that attractiveness is\nirresistible almost chemically\nirresistible in the sense that there is\na physiological response in our bodies\nwhen we look an attractive face\nafter considering all of these factors\nwhy are people staring at the woman in\nthe video I mean think about it there\nare men who are married with their\nPartners there are boys girls everybody\neveryone's looking at her why well we\nestablish why attractiveness is hard to\nresist from both an evolutionary and\nphysiological standpoint women in the\nvideo is considered attractive by\nWestern beauty standards interestingly\nobservers seem to pay more attention to\nher body despite facial features being\nthe more unique and personal feature of\nthe body why does that happen Gervais\nand colleagues found that individuals\nwho are more appearance focused spent\nless time looking at a woman's face and\nmore time looking at their chests and\nwaist compared to those who are more\npersonality focused in other words in\ncontext where appearance is considered\nmore important than personality female\nbodily features become more relevant\nthan facial features a stranger walking\nby in public fits that pretty well\nbecause after all they aren't looking at\nher from across the street to find out\nwhat her personality is like\nand so this should highlight that there\nis a downside to attractiveness as well\nespecially for women participants in the\nstudy showed increased attention to the\nbodies of women with attractive bodies\nsuggesting that attractive women are\nmore likely to receive an objectifying\ngaze indeed while there is also a gender\nbias in that study the objectifying gaze\nis not exclusive to men the women in the\nvideo received gazes from women as well\nbecause attractive women can be\nperceived as competition or should just\nbeing admired for her beauty\nsome people in the comments attribute\nall of that staring to the women's dress\nnot being appropriate for the weather or\nthe camera or the narcissistic demeanor\nand while there could be some truth to\nthat it's more likely that people stare\nbecause it gives them pleasure it isn't\noften that you see people dress so\nlavishly with the camera following them\naround and we have to also consider that\nwe are hardwired to look at Attractive\npeople as well and overall we stare\nprimarily at Attractive people but not\nexclusively Attractive people we can\nclearly observe this phenomenon of\nAttractive people catching our attention\nbut there's also contextual factors as\nto why people stare like being in a town\nsquare with lots of strangers versus a\nschool classroom with your peers the\nlatter example May factor in your\npersonality more and it would also\nlikely be less objectifying but it\ndoesn't change the end result that\npeople will still be staring and people\nstare because they have an almost\nbiological compulsion to stare but\nsocially we don't find that to be\nacceptable and so you have to overwork\nyour biological compulsions by lowering\nyour gaze\nand with that being said if you'd like\nto learn about your beauty your face\nyour facial features visualizations of\nhow you would look and the structured\nguidance to improve or change the way\nthat you look you can head over to the\ngoose website and order a facial\nassessment from our team of doctors and\ndentists and as always I'll catch you\nall in the next one"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Video Title: Why Do Athletes Have More Attractive Faces"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "here is a concept to consider our\nathletic people really more beautiful\nbecause the evolutionary biomarkers\nactually all add up to them being more\nbeautiful in theory I mean think about\nit they're genetically advantaged\nbecause that's why they're athlete which\nmeans more symmetry less diseases all\nthose benefits they are physically fit\nlower levels of body fat better for\nensure robusticity sharper facial\nfeatures and so while Attractive people\ncan be found in any environment they\nseem to be more common amongst the\nathletes and so is there some truth to\nthe idea that attractive people\ngenerally are typically more athletic or\nmore correctly are athletic people more\nattractive the current literature\nregarding facial attractiveness and\nathletes does actually have a research\nstudy into this let's break down the\nstudy and some reasons why athletes May\nin fact be better looking there is also\nan observable Phenomenon with more\nskilled athletes tend to be more\nattractive than less skilled ones and\nthat's a weird question we have to\nanswer lastly we're going to examine\nsomething called the positive social\nknowledge Theory outlined by leital in\ntheir study a paper by back in Bull 2017\nMay lend us some perspectives into the\nbeauty athlete relationship while\nresearch that directly states that\nathletes are more attractive appears to\nbe lacking the paper does have some\nimplications according to backing bull\nmore skilled athletes are also more\nattractive and in that study she notes\nthat there is a significant correlation\nbetween physical attractiveness and\nathletic performance amongst tennis\nplayers though it may not be the sport\nitself which results in a more\nattractive phase and so we're going to\nexamine the reasons why that is in just\na second but the study actually\nconcludes that coaches or managers would\nbenefit from hiring more attractive\ntennis players and this is because the\nmore attractive players tend to be more\nsuccessful which results in higher prize\nearnings and greater sponsorships all of\nthese findings applied to both men and\nwomen and clearly facial attractiveness\nis an important factor even for athletes\nusage by mutz and Maya confirmed this\nwhere noting that soccer players public\nattention is contingent on their\nathletic performance and their physical\nattractiveness I mean just look at\nRonaldo the men and women who are both\nskilled and attractive are the most\npopular and back in Bull would indicate\nthat the two go hand in hand these\nfindings raise some questions as to why\nthe more skilled athletes are more\nphysically attractive the answer to that\nquestion could perhaps be extended to\nanswer why athletes are more attractive\nthan non-athletes we're going to touch\non some of the social reasons for why\nthat is but there may also be a physical\none from an evolutionary perspective for\none the more skilled athletes may just\nbe in better shape resulting in the\nincreased performance it is also the\ncase that a more attractive base views\ninto underlying health where an athlete\nwho has developed healthier may be more\nefficient at their respective sport for\nexample a strong jaw indicates healthy\nDental facial development the growth of\nthe jaw is often associated with airwave\nfunction you can imagine where we're\ngoing with this where an athlete with\nproper Airway function would have an\nadvantage in having a strong defined jaw\nand thus making them conventionally\nattractive in the book sleep a\ncomprehensive handbook Dr Lee Chong\nnotes that maxillary or mandibular\nhyperplasia the growth or not lack of\ngrowth from the upper and lower jaw is a\nrepresentation of the most common\ncontributing skeletal causes of\nobstructive sleep apnea basically having\nan underdeveloped jaw can obstruct your\nAirway and that is not to say that you\nshouldn't have a chisel Jaw from Granite\nTo Be An Athlete but a well-developed\njaw is a pretty big indicator that you\nhave a good chance of being a pretty\nsuccessful athlete there may also be an\nalternative explanation for why athletes\nare judged as more attractive at least\naccording to a paper by leital where\nthis paper investigated the relationship\nbetween video game skills sexual\ndimorphism and facial attractiveness all\nof the concepts they discuss can be\napplied to basically any social\nenvironment but other research by\nwangital and Quinn and Mark Ray also\nemphasize that social information does\nplay a role in judgment's official\nattractiveness this is common sense but\nhow does it really apply to athletes and\nespecially the famous ones well people\ntend to attribute positive social\njudgments to famous athletes because\nthey are highly skilled at their Sport\nand this is especially true if the\nperson judging also plays a sport or\nwatched it enough the aforementioned\npapers the two papers we just spoke\nabout all discuss a bottom-up visual\ncomponent to attractiveness as well as a\ntop-down social knowledge component so\nwe're looking at why these people are\nattractive from two different Frameworks\nof beauty where they're physically\nattractive but also they're socially\nattractive and the visual approach\ncovers things like averageness and\nsexual dimor orphism we follow the\nchannel you know those are things that\nmake a face attractive but also social\nknowledge can impact perceptions of\nattractiveness with no other social\ninformation one's facial cues you know\nthe dimorphisms the averageness how\nsymmetrical your face is are the only\nway to assess your attractiveness an\nexample would be using a dating app but\nyou'll provide no other information\nabout yourself in the bio on the other\nhand most normal people know a few\nthings about famous athletes you know we\nknow Ronaldo has a lot of money Messi\nhas a lot of money Gerard Pique a lot of\nmoney and something about Shakira that\npositive social information is available\nprimarily through social media people\nassociate Cristiano Ronaldo's success\nwith positive characteristics like\ncompetence because he's a successful\nathlete he can probably be a successful\nprogrammer if you really wanted to and\nso he has conventionally attractive\nvisual cues but that's only one side of\nthe coin in fact athletes seem to\nmaximize both the visual side of facial\nattractiveness and the social side most\nsports such as track and field tennis\nfootball basketball all require you to\nbe in shape and this means being at a\nrelatively low body fat percentage and\ncarrying a healthy amount of muscular\ndevelopment and so not all athletes fit\nconventional standards of facial\nattractiveness through the averageness\nthe dimorphism disproportion symmetry or\neven having defined bone structure but\nathletes have maximized their potential\nand this is key to why most athletes\ntend to be more attractive than the\naverage person\neven if sport itself may not make a\nattractive face that sub-population of\nathletes pre-selects for being in shape\nwhich often is tied to facial\nattractiveness meaning they're typically\nworn attractive more or less and they\nbecome athletes second not the other way\naround this concept can also be applied\nto lesser known athletes or even young\nathletes in school men typically find\nathletic women attractive and vice versa\nand there are visual and health cues\nthat explain some of that however there\nalso seems to be a social Aura around\nathletes in high school and University\nwhere in the US for example collegia\nSports command a lot of attention money\nand buyers and if you intend one of\nthose Sports schools then it's almost\nimpossible to not have some kind of\nsocial bias towards athletes as being\nSuperstars the same can be said for high\nschool and universities in other parts\nof the world or maybe less so like in\ncountries like Australia we don't really\ncare about athletes that much but there\nis still a social element to being an\nathlete no doubt about that\nit also seems to be the case that the\nsport itself is largely irrelevant the\npaper by Lai atal demonstrates that this\napplies even to people that play video\ngames esport athletes the only caveat is\nthat if the sport is more obscure like\ntable tennis ping pong juggling then\nmost people don't have enough\ninformation to provide positive social\nknowledge I mean if you're the best\njungler in League of Legends other than\nother League of Legends players people\ndon't really care and they don't know\nwhat that means but you could be making\nmillions of dollars a year this is why\nless of attractive athletes Encompass\nmainly the most popular sports and this\nincludes Olympic sports football\nbasketball tennis to name a few lyotal\nnoted that for non-gamers the gaming\nskill did not influence their perception\nof facial attractiveness in other words\na girl who knows nothing about\ngymnastics wouldn't appreciate the level\nof skill and difficulty that entails and\nshe would rely on visual cues to\ndetermine somebody's facial\nattractiveness like a male gymnast\nalthough most people do have at least\nsome basic recognition that being top\none percent in any sport is a difficult\nidea even at a physical aspect but on\nthe other hand lots of people simply\ndon't play video games for example so\nthis doesn't apply strictly to video\ngames but it does to a lot of physical\nSports this is why the athlete Beauty\nbias applies to most sports except for\nthe really obscure ones video games are\na unique example even though they are\nstill quite popular but still most\npeople don't really have a positive\nsocial perception regarding video games\nusually they think their basement\ndwelling neckbeards but even if they do\nthere are many different kinds of video\ngames out there is a world-class Tetris\nplayer the same as a world-class social\nEsports player like maybe again League\nof Legends lyotol does give some\nevidence that the athlete Beauty buyer\nstill extends to Gamers but it requires\npositive social knowledge meaning that\nyou have to be a gamer of that game\nitself to understand that this person is\na top one percent player and get that\nbeauty bias so with all this being said\nthere is enough evidence to conclude\nthat the truth to athletes being more\nbeautiful is in fact a real bias we've\ntouched on a few of these in this video\nbut this is generally the theme of what\nwe've covered in most of the videos on\nthe channel most interesting of which is\npositive social knowledge which relates\nto the halo effect which I'm sure many\nof you have heard of where you get\npositive attributes ascribed to you just\nfor being physically attractive or\npositive social knowledge is a similar\nbias there are physical differences as\nwell between athletes and non-athletes\nwhere athletes generally have to stay in\nshape for most sports from F1 to\nfootball there is also a selection bias\nwhereby athletes are typically selected\nfor their ability to stay in shape or\nhaving healthy identifacial development\nand more correctly having better genetic\nHealth they don't have the special\nfacial shapes that is exclusively gained\nthrough sports but if you want to find\nattractive facial structure look no\nfurther than the world's top models\nbecause athletes are not selected for\ntheir beauty it's just a second\nbyproduct that comes from their sport\nofficial attractiveness is more a\ncombination of genetics chance and\nenvironmental factors because they're\nnot selected to be good looking just\nlike models athletes are also an\nexcellent shape and as a byproduct of\nthat they tend to be more attractive\nthan the average person that's really\nthe question we're trying to answer here\nthough most athletes may not have the\nsame model-esque bone structure they are\ndoing the best with the facial features\nthat they were dealt and it's not what\nthey're selected for in the first place\neven among athletes there is a beauty\nbias so more attractive athletes are\nmore successful and skilled and they\nwill be more likely to gain higher\npaying contracts and sponsorships\nbecause at the end of the day sport is\nreally for the entertainment of the\nmasses and so we're all at risk of\npreferring more better looking\nSportsmen's and women's but overall\nevolutionary physical fitness explains\nmost of why athletes are considered\nbeautiful and social perceptions\nexplains the rest of it this doesn't\nmean that all athletes are attractive\nobviously but it is an observable Trend\nand the facial appearance of athletes do\nvary just like they do in the general\npopulation but on average athletes are\nmore attractive than the average person\nthat being said if you'd like to learn\nmore about your face where you sit on\nthis spell curve attractive and less\nattractive and your facial morphology\nthe shape itself and get an assessment\nperformed by a team of doctors and\ndentists over at the coup's website as\nalways I'll catch you all in the next\none"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Video Title: What Makes Henry Cavill So Attractive? | The Classically Handsome Look"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "all right so I guess we're doing this\ntoday we're taking a look at Henry\nCavill aka Superman he was one of the\nmost requested names for the analyzing\ncelebrity faces series and it's pretty\nclear to see why he's getting a lot of\ntraction in today's film industry from\nbeing known for his roles in Superman\nobviously and also geralt of Rivia in\nThe Witcher series and it may seem like\nthere isn't a lot of depth to analyzing\nHenry's stereotypically attractive white\nactor with basic attractive features\nconventionally attractive features type\nof analysis but we can still take a look\nat what makes him so classically\nhandsome and also talk about facial\nrobusticity the masculin-ness of his\nface which is something that we haven't\ngotten a chance to talk about with other\nfaces\nand of course no face is Flawless so\nHenry is in fact human like the rest of\nus not Kryptonian contrary to popular\nbelief and the roles and personas that\nhe likes to upkeep however this video is\ngoing to focus on what makes him\nclassically and scientifically\nattractive by following the tenets of\nfacial attractiveness the first thing\nthat catches the eye is Henry's General\nfacial shape and proportions he has a\nstereotypically squared off wide and\nmasculinized face a couple of\nproportions result in the overall look\nand firstly his facial turds are\ndistributed so that his middle third\nwhere the nose occupies is the smallest\nproportion of the face this is usually\nattractive because it gives the illusion\nof a smaller and proportionally shorter\nnose and we can see how his proportion\nseems to vary if he grows out his beard\nthe lower proportion of the face\nvertically lengthens and further\nmasculinizes that distribution also\nfacial hair is just masculinizing in and\nof itself Henry's entire midface region\nis quite compact with a facial width to\nheight ratio approaching two times\nmeaning his facial width from Zion to\nzygon or the cheekbone to cheekbone is\nalmost two times as wide as the high of\nhis midface region I like to explain it\nlike think of the headlights of a\nBugatti you know um a Lamborghini any\ntype of sports car think of how they're\nshaped wide narrow and aggressive\nlooking and there's a reason why that\ntends to look good in masculine life\nspaces as well for the same logic that\nit looks dominant and aggressive in\ngeneral this is an attractive and\nmasculinizing crate because it signals\nstrong dentofacial growth or bone\nstructure both laterally and forward and\nis usually associated with high\ncheekbones like in Henry's case a study\nby Catherine and Dixon sought to examine\nthe sexual dimorphism so the\nmasculin-ness and the feminine-ness as\nit relates to the bisogomatic width or\nthe cheekbone width and they found Stark\nsexually dimorphic differences in that\nspecific measurement meaning that the\nbi-zygomatic width seems to be the most\ncorrelated with things like shoulder\nwidth but circumference chest\ncircumference and head breath and if\nyour face is wide generally your body is\nalso wide and stocky too now it's also\nhighly correlated with whey which can\naffect all of those things as well and\nwe've seen all experience how putting on\na few pounds can really puff out the\ncheeks and make your face look wider so\nthere's no surprises there\nhowever the width of the cheeks could\nalso be an example of a masculine\ndimorphic development where more\nmasculine men would commonly have a\nthicker neck and chest but also a\nthicker and wider face Henry definitely\ndoes possess all of those traits Henry's\nmidface is also in itself a perfect one\nto one square meaning it doesn't look\noverly squished or long and that's\ngenerally attractive then of course the\nupper and lower part of the face also\ncontributes to that squared off look is\nby going your width or the Dual width is\nslightly less than his cheekbone width\nand it's also not overly wide or narrow\nand so there's a general Trend\napproaching where everything is quite\nshapely without being overly deviant\nwhich leads into the idea of facial\naverageness\nHenry's by temporowit or the forehead\nwidth is also quite similar at about 90\npercent of his cheekbone width and it\ngives that 90 look that produces a\nharmonized and masculine as facial\nContour there is General agreement\nbetween his facial shape and the\nproportions where no third of the face\nseems too notably narrow or wide and\nthat's a significant takeaway for why\nHenry has such a shapely looking face\nMr Cavill also likes to experiment with\na lot of different hairstyles and facial\nhair lengths and thus his look does vary\na lot for example if he has grown out\nthe sides of his head that by temporal\nwidth may seem a bit wider than the\nmiddle and lower parts of his face and\nsimilarly longer facial hair gives the\nillusion of widening out the jaw growing\nup sideburns gives the illusion of wider\ncheekbones and I think you can all\nunderstand that this can apply to your\nown face where you can adjust the\nproportions of your face simply by the\nhair on your face playing around with\nthese factors to one's Advantage is\nactually quite overlooked in making\npositive glow ups to your face\nHenry also has a great foundation so he\ncan generally pull off every hairstyle\nhe tries and as we've explained in\nprevious videos regarding the science of\nhairstyles research generally shows that\nattractive faces can pull off any\nhairstyle because they have the right\nset of bone structure and facial\nrobusticity to look attractive\nregardless of what the hairstyle really\nlooks like but going back to Henry's\ncase his curlier hair texture can also\nadd width to the face depending on the\nlength and also adds an element of\nuniqueness and Flair to the face and\nstraight ahead generally wouldn't\nachieve that effect perhaps Henry's\nstrongest facial feature are the eyes\nthey're virtually Flawless spacing and\ndimorphic markers which in simple speak\njust means that they're very\nmasculinized looking we've touched on in\nthe past their eyes being one iopod as a\ngenerally accepted assessment of eye\nspacing and it doesn't give the whole\npicture but it is usually a positive\nthing to have your eyes be spaced\ncorrectly and resize are exactly one eye\nwidth apart and additionally his\ninterpupillary distance or exactly how\nit sounds the disc distance between the\ninner pupils of the eyes is harmoniously\npositioned relative to his total facial\nwidth and in other words his eyes appear\nneither too wide set or closed set but\nright in the middle individually\ndistance is also a sexually dimorphic\ntrait similar to cheekbone width\naccording to ratanatal where men overall\njust have wider facial features on\naverage his eyes are three times wider\nthan they are tall which again is\nneither too narrow or too rounded\nlooking and this is becoming quite a\ntrend where generally Henry's facial\nproportions are quite average in the\nsense that they lie right in the\nmathematical Center of hot and cold\nsome slight upper eyelid exposure and\neye bags are not traditionally thought\nof as attractive because it leads to a\ntired or worn out look but in Henry's\ncase it may work to humanize his eye\narea or else he'll just look\nsculpture-like in robotic and while his\neyes are deep set it is mainly from the\nbrow Ridge protrusion where his\nmaxillary or the midface region is quite\nforward grown but it does lack some bone\nor fatty deposits right under the eye\nthis could be just genetic but it also\nappears to have gotten worse with age as\nthose fatty deposits start to wane down\nthe average protrusion is another\ndimorphic quality and it's exactly as it\nsounds our caveman ancestors had\nincredibly prominent brow ridges because\nthey would head bash each other and\nmodern humans don't have much of a need\nfor that but it is still a remnant of\nmasculinized faces where the extreme\nmasculinized faces like Henry almost\nhave it found exclusively in men brow\nbone protrusion is highly correlated\nwith having the eyebrows closer to the\neyes according to Goldstein and cattle\nwits in fact it probably causes it this\nis demonstratable in Henry's guess where\nthere is little to no distance between\nhis eye line and his eyebrows and this\ngives a more aggressive again\nLamborghini looking face that's the only\nway I can explain it since dimorphism is\nattractive because it signals health and\nfertility traits like these that make\nmen look like men and women look like\nwomen especially attractive perhaps even\nmore so for the male group you see the\nbrow bone is literally the human version\nof antlers and we made a video with our\nbiologist Simon groom as to why humans\nwould have ever needed to have these\naggressive facial features to protect\nthemselves from other humans trying to\nagain head bash them\nwith the brow burn protrusion there is a\ndifference in racial and genetic\ncomponents as well but in general having\nmore pronounced brow bones is usually\nassociated with masculinity the last and\nfinally most obvious thing we're going\nto be talking about is the\nsuperman-esque jaw and that allows Henry\nto play The Bold and uncompromising\ncharacters that he does when you think\nof a Greek demigod from the film\nImmortals Clark Ken or Gerald of Rivia\nthat kind of jaw is almost a\nprerequisite I mean think about it you\ncan't really have a weak jawline if\nyou're playing a superhero it just\ndoesn't make sense typecasting is a real\nthing and to convincingly star in the\nroles requires having a hyper\nwesternized masculine face and I say\nwesternized because in the west we have\na reference for facial robusticity\nbasically sharp angular features in the\nEast not so much is ramus length which\nis this section of the lower jaw here is\nlikely in the 99th percentile and this\nhyper masculinizes the lower a third\nbecause Remus length is a strong\nsexually dimorphic indicator it's so\nsexually dimorphic that we've discussed\nin the past how a skeleton can be\nidentified of its sex with a high degree\nof certainty just using this one facial\ntrait alone a near vertical ramus\ncombined with the forward-grown lower\njaw gives Henry a low gonial angle or\nthe jaw angle of around 120 degrees the\nproportion of the ramus to the mandible\nbody or the lower jaw shows us that his\nRemus is long in comparison his mandible\nand Chin are also very forward grown and\nthough it remains harmonious it doesn't\nlook odd or overly deviant like he has\nsome kind of orthodontic anomaly\nin the past we've also shown from\northodontic analysis that the\nintersection of lines across the front\nof the jaw is a powerful indicator of\nlower third attractiveness according to\nsaponaro atal despite the study applying\nto female models the frontal jaw angle\nis actually quite a strong Universal\nattractiveness indicator where the angle\nof men may be one to two degrees lower\non average due to having wider chins but\nit still does apply with a high degree\nof certainty most attractive men and\nwomen have a jawline in frontal view\nthat does not appear too flat or too\ninclined and narrow in Henry's case his\njaw is actually a bit on the flatter\nside but it is still very reasonably\nattractive\nanother commonly used cephalometric\nassessment is to compare this\nmeasurement to an angle between the\nalabase or the nose and the outer corner\nof the eye called the lateral canthus\nusually these two angles should be\npretty close to one another with a\ndeviation of no more than 15 degrees to\nmaintain Harmony Henry is about 9\ndegrees off if we take it from the nose\nbase so he's not doing too bad there\neither\nhowever compared to the study's method\nof the allo or the nose Wing he falls\noutside of that ideal range in the\ninterest of time we're going to Breeze\nthrough a couple of the commonly used\ndentofacial assessments that an\northodontist would use to look at a\nperson's bone structure Henry doesn't\nhave any significant chin recession or\nweakness and if we take the rank Fort\nhorizontal plane which is just a line\nthat runs from the ear through the\norbital bones of the under eye and then\nrun a line from the chin perpendicular\nto that the chin should slightly\nsuppress the LaBella or the nasian at\nminimum to not be considered recessed\nalso the gonian or the lowest corner of\nthe back jaw should be below a line\ndrawn from the mouth parallel to the\nTranquil plane Henry passes all of these\ntests with impeccable interfacial\ndevelopment and even his lips have a\npronounced Cupid bow which is considered\nan attractive trait and you may notice\nthat people with fetal alcohol syndrome\ndon't actually have a Cupid's bow and\nthat's why that is also a commonly\nattractive trait because it indicates\nyou don't have any genetic malformations\nthe line drawn from the base of the chin\naka the pagonian to the nasal tip is\nvery commonly used in Dental facial\nassessment this is called the rickets\ne-plane where Henry does well by this\ntest and his larger nasal protrusion or\nthe strength of his nose harmonizes well\nwith the strength of his chin in\ncomparison\nso it's no surprise that Henry Cavill is\nprobably one of the arguably better\nlooking men on the planet both\ncephalometrically and by Western beauty\nstandards he fits the bill of the\nattractive protagonist while the Western\nstarted from an attractive Caucasian man\ncan be quite superficial in terms of\nanalysis Henry Cavill is not a normally\nattractive man and he is definitely in\nthe upper thresholds of look in\nproducing a face that is not very\ncommonly seen and with that being said\nif you'd like to learn more about your\nfacial development if you have the Henry\nCavill jawline and a general assessment\nof your features how you can improve the\nway that you look or what you can do

"content": "do you think women would prefer this\nface or this one or perhaps both what\nmakes a man attractive tends to be more\ncontroversial than what makes a woman\nattractive male Beauty does not always\nequate to masculinity as masculinity can\nsignal both positive and negative\naspects for example a man may be\nappearing more masculine stronger and\ndominant but he could also have the\nnegative traits of higher testosterone\nleading to more aggressive and dangerous\nand so for a feminine partner this can\npresent a trade-off that they have to\nconsider between the positive and the\nnegative and this is a very well\nestablished theory in sociobiology as a\nresult women's definition of\nattractiveness is actually quite\nvariable some prefer more masculine\ntraits such as thick eyebrows or\nrectangular eyes while others may prefer\nmore feminized traits such as a rounded\nnose or Fuller lips so what do women\nprefer well-defined and smooth features\na bearded or clean-shaven face of mature\nor youthful appearance a more masculine\nor the more androgynous pretty boy look\nin this video we're going to try to talk\na bit about male beauty standards that\ndo exist in the scientific literature\nperhaps the most important indicators of\nmasculinity and attractiveness in men\nare those that are related to the\noverall size and shape of the face such\nas the mandibular prominent or the\njawline these physical traits are often\nassociated with an individual's hormonal\nlevels and serve as signs of dominant\nmaturity and virility for example having\nhigh levels of body fat will disguise\nthe face and it's very apparent to see\nand we can logically assume that you're\nprobably not as athletic the size of the\nchin is related to attractiveness in men\nseveral studies have found that a large\nchin area both in length and width is a\ndesirable feature another important\ntrait associated with the perception of\nfacial attractiveness is chin prominent\nwhich refers to the degree in which the\nchin extends in relation to the rest of\nthe face this can be measured by\nconsidering the different elements of\nthe face 90 and colleagues found that\nthe most attractive faces were those\nwith chains of average protrusion this\nmeans that the chin with an extension\nsimilar to those that you would find in\nthe majority of the population was\nconsidered the most attractive while\nfaces with mild deviations from the\naverage retained some of their\nattractiveness the greater the deviation\nthe less attractive the face was\ninterestingly the effects of retrosion\nwas more pronounced than the effects of\nprotrusion so having a chin that is too\nfar forward is not as much of a negative\nas having a chin that is not far enough\nanother feature that impacts\nattractiveness is the shape and\nprominence of the jaw men typically have\nwider Jaws than women so a wide jaw is a\nsign of masculinity when gilsky and\ncolleagues discovered that Jawbone\nprominence in facial high are two of the\nthree most important features for\nperceptions of masculinity the other\nbeing eyebrow thickness\nwindhager and colleagues studied the\ninfluence of dual shape on perceptions\nof attractiveness in their paper\ngeometric morphometrics of male facial\nshape in relation to physical strength\nand attractiveness the authors analyzed\ndifferent types of male profiles Strong\nhigh body fat dominant masculine and\nattractive heavyset profiles share a\nprominent lower jaw but the jawline is\nrounder in men with higher body fat and\nmore angular in strong individuals on\nthe other hand slender faces have the\nmore angular jaw lines compared to the\nheavy surfaces in other words a rounded\nlower third is a sign of higher body fat\nwhich is considered an undesirable\ncharacteristic for sexual attractiveness\ninterestingly the authors found that the\nmost attractive profile was the one that\nhad a narrower jaw and an angular\nwell-defined jawline on the other hand\nwomen tend to rate male faces with a\nprominent lower jaw as more dominant but\nnot necessarily as more attractive think\nof the drill sergeant Minecraft Steve\nsquare jaw compared to maybe say K-pop\nboy band member who has a more feminized\nbut slender and attractive jawline which\none would women more likely choose\nprobably not the drill sergeant jaw\nfinally cheekbone prominence while still\nhaving an impact on perceived\nmasculinity and attractiveness was found\nto be less important in conclusion\nfeatures in the lower third of the face\nparticularly this shape and size of the\njaw and the chin as well as the overall\nfacial height are important indicators\nof male facial attractiveness\none of the most distinct characteristics\nof male faces is the presence of facial\nhair so what is the impact of facial\nhair and attractiveness beards generally\nconsidered signals of both positive\naspects such as experience or dominance\nand negative ones such as aggressiveness\nin a study conducted by Dixon and\ncolleagues titled the masculinity\nParadox the author studied several\naspects of facial hair in men they\narrived at the interesting conclusion\nthat lie in heavy stubble faces were\nmore attractive than either full bearded\nand clean-shaven faces in other words\nthe amount of hair that you have on your\nface does matter in addition by\ndigitally manipulating the photographs\nused in the study they discovered\nthey're very masculine and very feminine\nmale faces were less attractive than\nfaces of average masculinity when they\nwere clean-shaven this implies that\nbeards disguise extreme masculine or\nfeminine traits presenting the face as\nmore smooth Dow or average and therefore\nmaking it more attractive not only does\nthe amount of facial hair matter but it\nalso matters in regards to its\ndistribution the same authors described\nin their paper the role of facial and\nbody hair distribution in women's\njudgments of male sexual attractiveness\nthat men with more evenly and\ncontinuously distributed facial hair\nwere perceived as more sexually\nattractive than individuals with the\nmore patchy hair that should be common\nsense to most men in this video we also\nshowed that having a beard was\nbeneficial for men with smaller jaw\nlines and significantly increase their\nattractiveness and masculinity\nin conclusion having a beard can\ndefinitely impact a man's attractiveness\nand masculinity although the results are\ndifferent depending on his underlying\nbone structure and paying attention to\nthat actually matters a lot more on\nwhether you should have a beard or not\npeople usually focus on the eyes when\nfirst seeing a face while big eyes are\nconsidered a sign of femininity for\nwomen masculinity is typically\nassociated with a smaller more\nrectangular eye size compared to the\nroundness of the eye itself when it\ncomes to male attractiveness women's\npreference for eye size also depends on\nthe context for example cuttingham and\ncolleagues found in their Pioneer paper\nwhat do women want that generally women\nprefer larger eyes in both in high and\nwidth that is the more feminine eye\nshape however mogilski and colleagues\nfound that smaller more masculinized\neyes were preferred in the context of\nshort-term dating this aligns with an\nimportant characteristic of masculinity\nperception which we have discovered in\nother videos that more masculine traits\nare considered attractive for short-term\ndating prospects think of one night\nstands hookups that kind of culture\nwhereas they are less preferential in\nlong-term dating prospects such as\nmarriage or a lifelong partner despite\nthese discrepancies both authors agree\nthat eye size is an important aspect of\nmale facial attractiveness another\nrelated feature is eyebrow thickness\nwhere interestingly mcgillskin\ncolleagues found that this feature is\neven more important than eye size as a\nsignal of masculinity this means that\nhaving thick eyebrows is a stronger\nindicator of masculinity than having the\nmasculine eye shape so when it comes to\nthe eye color itself we've also made a\nvideo on that topic on the channel\nthe mouth is the central feature of the\nlower third of the face and it often\ncaptures some of the most attention\nmaking an important first impression\nmasculinity is often associated with an\nellipse on average which is often\nconsidered a sign of dominance male\nfaces with thin lips are sometimes rated\nas more attractive than those with thick\nlips because men typically don't have\nthick voluptuous lips compared to women\nhowever some Studies have shown that\nmale faces with full ellipse can also be\nconsidered attractive so which one is it\ntherefore it appears that the size of\nthe lips doesn't significantly have a\ndetermining Factor on attractiveness as\nlong as they are within proportion as\nthe ratings of attractiveness do vary\ndepending on other features of the mouth\nitself not just this volume of the lips\nso with that in mind the size of the\nmouth does impact attractiveness grammar\nand colleagues have found that men with\nwider mouths are considered more\nattractive possibly because this feature\nis associated with good health and more\nimportantly with proportion therefore\nmount size is a robust indicator of\nattractiveness more so than lip size an\ninteresting question is whether Dental\nAesthetics have any impact on male\nattractiveness it is reasonable to\nexpect that men with better dentition in\nother words teeth and gum health are\nconsidered more attractive however how\nsignificant is the impact of this Dental\nappearance\nin Baker and colleagues paper objective\nassessment of the contribution of dental\nAesthetics and facial attractiveness in\nmen via eye tracking\ntheir experiment the subjects were\nranked according to their facial\nattractiveness and the level of dental\ntreatment that they required then the\nauthor showed these pictures to women\nand used eye tracking technology to find\nout which areas of the face captured\nmore attention for both highly\nattractive and unattractive men women\npaid attention to facial features in the\nfollowing order the eyes the mouth and\nthe nose however for men of average\nattractiveness the attention shifted to\nthe mouth this means that for average\nmen women pay more attention to the\nmouth and thus Dental Aesthetics\ndo have a very important role on your\nfacial appearance in addition the effect\ndepends on the level of dental treatment\nneeded by the subject himself the most\nsevere conditions visual attention was\nshifted to the mouth irrespective of the\noverall attractiveness level and perhaps\nyou've seen this for yourself where\nsomebody may have a very beautiful face\nbut they open their mouth and their\nteeth may not be in the best shape and\nthat does unfairly capture a lot of\nattention this means that if the dental\nstatus of the individual is severe no\nmatter how attractive he is he will most\nlikely benefit from the dental treatment\ninterestingly visual attention to the\nmouth of feminine faces were never\nexceeded that compared to the eye these\nresults suggest that in men the\nattention to an anesthetic dentition is\nmore pronounced and that Dental\nAesthetics have more of an influence on\nmen than does on women\nlet's talk about the nose so the nose is\nthe central feature of the face and it's\nvery eye-catching as with other traits\nwhile there is consensus that a slim and\nsmall nose is an attractive feature on\nwomen because women typically have\nsmaller noses than men making it a\nsexually dimorphic feature it seems that\nmen can get away with a lot more nose\nshapes and sizes in agreement with this\nidea Cunningham and colleagues found in\ntheir research that the nose is a poor\npredictor of attractiveness meaning that\nthey did not find a strong correlation\nbetween nose size and perceived\nattractiveness in men just look at\nAdrian Brody on the other hand grammar\nand colleague states that a large nose\njust like a wide mouth is indicative of\ngood health and therefore it is\nconsidered attractive however some\nStudies have found that male faces which\nwere feminized by reducing the no size\nwere perceived as again more attractive\njust like the lips this one really\ndepends on the face itself and other\nfeatures so unlike women apparently no\nsize is not a particularly important\ntrait with respect to attractiveness in\nmen and men do get away with a lot more\nwhen it regards the nose shape itself as\nlong as it is within the average\nproportion and size that's seen in the\nmale population and it doesn't disturb\nthe overall symmetry of the face\na rather unusual but quite interesting\ntrait that can impact attractiveness is\nfacial scarring many Studies have shown\nthat in Western societies facial\nscarring has a negative impact on\nattractiveness since it provides\nevidence of past trauma or illness and\nmay suggest a risk-taking personality\nwhich can be considered undesirable in\nlong-term dating prospects however in\nthe paper titled facial scarring\nenhances males attractiveness for\nshort-term relationships Burris and\ncolleagues show that post-traumatic\nscarring even non-severe facial scarring\ncan enhance perceptions of\nattractiveness in men for short term but\nnot for long-term relationships as it\ncould be considered a sign of\nmasculinity violence aggression all of\nthe negative aspects basically culminate\ninto the scarring this means that as\nlong as the scars are superficial in\nother words not deformatory or cause\ndeformation of the face women can\nconsider them to be attractive in\npotential short-term Partners we've made\na full video on the subject which you'd\nlike to know more about or the influence\non facial attractiveness that's the one\nto watch interestingly facial scarring\ndid not enhance perceptions of\nattractiveness on feminine subjects\nwhere the study provides an interesting\nexample of an unexpected feature that\nunder certain context could make a face\nmore attractive especially for men so to\nround out this video women are attracted\nto men who exhibit a variety of\nattributes physically speaking and the\ndifferent traits are preferred in\ndifferent situations there is a\nsignificant influence on The Dating\ncontext when it comes to women's\npreferences in men this means that women\nprefer different types of men for\nshort-term versus long-term dating\nprospects under certain circumstances\nparticularly for short-term\nrelationships women tend to seek men who\nare more sexually matured and dominant\nperhaps maybe for protection aggression\nor just risk-taking behavior in these\nsituations male attractiveness is\nrelated to features that Express\nmaturity and dominance such as a larger\nchin and jaw or thicker facial hair on\nthe other hand women sometimes refer\nless massive faces especially in a\nlong-term major context features such as\nlarger eyes or a smaller nose which\nreflect General babyishness immaturity\nin neotony Express these attributes\nwhich could link to being a more\nempathetic father figure for children\nlater on and so if you'd like to learn\nmore about your facial features whether\nyou fall into the first or the second\ncategory how you can change the way that\nyou look and overall get a general\nassessment of your facial\ncharacteristics you can head over to the\ncrew's website and get a report\nperformed by a team of doctors and\ndentists for a analysis and breakdown of\nyour face as always that's on the curves\nwebsite and I'll catch you all in the\nnext one"}]}

Celebrity Faces"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "in today's video we're going to be\nanalyzing Top Model Iman hamam she is a\nDutch model of Moroccan and Egyptian\ndescent and has been taking over Runway\nsince 2013. her natural yet assertive\nwalk is one of the best out there right\nnow arguably and overall she brings the\nwhole package for when it comes to\nmodeling beauty standards from her walk\nher dress her facial expressions and\nbodily features such as her height which\nall lend themselves to high fashion\namong some of the most popular branches\nwalk for Jean-Paul Gautier Givenchy and\nmost recently Versace and she has also\nmade her way onto many magazine covers\nlike Italian British and Dutch Folk so\napart from all of this it's very clear\nto see that her face is very attractive\nand fits well within Western beauty\nstandards at the same time she doesn't\nhave the polarizing look that a lot of\ntoday's models possess in having\nfeatures that are too extreme her face\nhas a nice blend of femininity and\naverageness or coinophilia as we're\ngoing to discuss and that gives her the\nmost unanimously attractive set of\nfeatures so let's get into the specific\nfacial features that make this face\nparticularly attractive and why it's\narguably as close to as perfect as a\nface can get when we're talking about\nthe mathematics of facial attractiveness\nso an important thing to remember as we\nget into specific features is that\naverageness or coinophilia as the Greek\ndiscernment is one of if not the most\nimportant thing when it comes to making\nan attractive face it seems to be an\nalmost Universal Beauty standard that is\nfound cross-culturally across people of\nall human generations and research by\nRubenstein atal and Rhodes are just two\nexamples in a long list of research\nconfirming the importance of spatial\naverageness Iman undoubtedly possesses a\nhigh degree of facial averageness this\nsyllogistic argument lays out why one\nthat attractive faces possess High\nfacial averageness two Iman has a highly\nattractive face and three one must have\nbifacial averageness by Logic just\nfollowing back to the face being\nconsidered very attractive we have in\nthe past and we will continue to make\nmore videos explaining in depth the\nconcept of facial averageness but when\nyou hear the concept think of\nmathematical normality a base that is\nnot too extreme more like a blank canvas\nof facial features this doesn't mean\nthat Iman has has a face that is\nconsidered average in attractiveness as\nin a 5 out of 10 but rather her face has\nnormal looking proportion than features\nand is clear of any tumors deviations\nmalformations or extreme facial\ndimorphism for example iman's nose is\nnot too large or nor is it too small a\njaw has normal facial alignment if you\nwere to ask an orthodontist they would\nsay that her jaw and facial features are\nproperly developed and her eyes are not\ntoo upturned or droopy and her lips are\nnot too full or thin so quantifying the\naverageness is a technical procedure but\nif you remember the general concept it\nmakes the rest of the video a lot\nclearer to understand perhaps the best\nexample to demonstrate the idea of\naverageness is with iman's eyes iman's\neyes are notably upturned but not to an\nextreme extent you can imagine how lying\nat the extremes would make the eyes look\nuncanny she is right in the middle Zone\nthat maximizes facial Harmony one\nclinical study by Sahara natal evaluated\nthe different eye characteristics of 163\nfemale patients and their findings as\nwell as the past literature they discuss\nagree with the general sentiment of\nfacial averageness pertaining to how\nupturned the eyes are they used a\nmeasure called the palpable axis which\nwe have also called the intercounter\ntill on this channel in the past and\nthis measurement varies between ethnic\ngroups but nonetheless imman Falls in\nline with the general attractive ranges\nthat have been laid out in past\nscientific literature her outer eye is\nabout 10 degrees higher than the inner\neye which explains why she has that\nfeline model-esque appearance to her eye\nregion still this is not an abnormal\namount of tilt and the researchers note\nthat an attractive African face has a 10\ndegree til on average interestingly an\nattractive Caucasian or African Face\nseems to benefit from a steeper Iceland\nand the other General groups don't the\nmain idea here is to point out that the\nharmonious Middle Ground is where iman's\nfacial attractiveness is maximized it is\nless about a specific number because\nwhat is 9 degrees versus 10 it makes no\ndifference but more to the overarching\nidea of what makes an attractive face in\nthis sense averageness or\nprototypicality the ITIL is just one of\nthose features that is in the middle\nground and so are the rest of the\nfeatures which is what makes the overall\nface above average in terms of\nattractiveness\nhopefully you're following on to the\nidea here where in Photoshop we can see\nhow making iman's eyes less upturned\nbegins to detract from her facial\nattractiveness and this is because we go\nbeyond facial Harmony especially if it\ngets too far from that 10 degree Mark\nwhere the face just looks not human\nanymore if the angle is too low her eyes\nbegin to look overly droopy and she no\nlonger has the same striking alert\nappearance on the opposite end if the\nangle is too high the face begins to\nlook to feel I like almost uncanny\ncarrying on with that concept the\nspacing of iman's eyes is another visual\nrepresentation of her excellent facial\naverageness this is because the eyes are\nright in the center of our faces it is\none of the first things we look at when\nwe're trying to recognize a person in\nthe same paper the ratio of\ninter-pupillary distance to maximum\nwidth of the face is examined we can\ndemonstrate how altering iman's ratio\nbegins to affect her facial averageness\nand as a result facial attractiveness as\nwell in line with other research on the\nsubject a face appears most attractive\nwhen the distance between the pupils is\nabout 46 six percent of the facial width\nand in the past we've covered how this\ndoes change between different research\npapers but this can also vary slightly\nbetween racial groups and face shapes\nand between men and women but we can\nshow it through Photoshop that's strange\ntoo far from that general idea of 46 or\nthat middle ground makes iman's eyes\nappear too close together or too far\napart regardless of race attractive\nwomen typically have wider eyes like\nIman does compared to their less\nattractive counterparts and this means\nthat her eyes are slightly further apart\nand still within the idea of averageness\nin that same vein the eyes should be\nabout one eye apart this intuitively\nmakes sense when we think of\nmathematical averageness where Tamir\nreports the ideal eyes as large slanted\nand with the reasonable distance between\nthem so that the distance between the\neyes is about One Eye's width again this\ndoesn't mean the eyes have to be\nprecisely one ice with it's just the\ngeneral concept of normality in human\nfacial features the idea is that\ninterspatial distance between the eyes\nis neither too large or too small and\nthat's when things start to look\ndisproportionate aboriginess not only\napplies to facial proportions but also\nto things like symmetry skin quality and\nbody fat percentage Iman is at a healthy\nMiddle Ground of body fat percentage and\nthis accentuates her facial features\ngiving her what we prefer in the west\ncalled facial robusticity basically\nsharp angular facial features such as\nthe jawline and the cheekbones at the\nsame time her body also fits the\nprototypical slim Runway build that\nmodeling agencies look for and for some\nmodeling looks people often bring up the\nfact that models look too gone or too\nskinny this is not the case for Iman\nwhere her face is lean but still full\nenough to appear youthful if a body fat\npercentage was too low or too high a\nfacial attractiveness would diminish\nbecause it would again go away from the\naverageness of prototypicality it would\nnot look like a face that you would\nexpect to see on the runway a quick note\non her skin and facial symmetry as well\nboth are quite healthy and normal and\nshe doesn't have any severe skin\nblemishes or notable vertical or\nhorizontal asymmetry and again the idea\nof averageness is suggests that a tumor\na blemish acne are all things that\ndetract from facial averageness where it\nmakes the face look uneven\njust as iman's eyes are conventionally\nattractive her jaw structure is no\ndifferent so let's cover her jawline\nthis discusses her lips where the two\noften go hand in hand the cephalometric\nassessment of the jaw are best seen in\nthe side profile which is typically what\nan orthodontist would do to design a\ncorrect jawline and there is more than\njust information regarding the jaw\ngrowth pattern in other words a good jaw\nin the side profile often translates to\na pleasant appearance in the front\nprofile there are two things we want to\npoint out regarding iman's jaw growth\nthe first is the alignment and the\nforward prominence of the jaw the second\nfactor is the go kneel angle or the\nactual angle simply put it's asking is\nher jaw too round or too flat or\ndemonstrating downward growth patterns\nif it is then usually this Clues into\nJewel by issues such as overbytes\nunderbites open bites as you may expect\nan orthodontist to discuss with you\niman's Jewel alignment is quite Pleasant\nand her upper jaw is not too protruded\nwhich we would typically call maxillary\nprognatism in the industry neither is\nher lower jaw to protruded which we\nwould call mandibular prognitism and the\nupper lip is slightly more protrusive\nthan a lower lip which can indicate that\nher upper jaw is slightly more prominent\nthan her lower jaw and this is very\nnormal for All Humans this is a common\ncharacteristic among most attractive\nfaces actually where according to\nsophosetal this is seen where the jaw\nalignment produces a slightly convex or\nrounded facial profile like in iman's\ncase once again referring back to the\nconcept of averageness the profile\nshouldn't be overly flat or overly\nrounded and in rare cases the profile\ncan even be concave\nand if you don't believe me we can show\nthis by altering the alignment of iman's\njaw which completely Alters the harmony\nof her face if the angle is too low she\nappears to have a severe overbite if\nit's too high she appears to have an\nunderbite and keep in mind that the\nemphasis is not on a specific number but\nrather a range of normal values that all\nhumans typically tend to fall into and\nthis angle can vary a lot between ethnic\ngroups as covered in the past it can\nvary based on the brow Ridge prominence\nsuch as between men and women where men\nhave more prominent brow ridges and this\ncan change the value of expected normals\nbut the jaw alignment affects the\nfullness and proportion of ellipse\nwithout going into too much detail here\nshe has full lips that are not too\nprotrusive her upper lip is slightly\nmore prominent in the side profile which\nis pleasant and in the front her lower\nlip is slightly taller than the upper\nlip which also seems to be favorable\naccording to Dr Mandy's book The Art of\nthe lip there are of course ethnic\nvariations to the lip sizes as well as\nwe may all know but as long as one lip\nis not significantly Fuller in\ndisproportion to the other it will look\nnormal and attractive man also has a\ndefined jaw with the normal angle of 122\ndegrees and this is not the\ntraditionally square jaw nor is it an\nextremely feminized rounded jaw either\nit seems to carry over to the frontal\nprofile where the same thing can be said\nresearched by maoetal explains this\nexact Topic in their paper they refer to\nthe angle as the mandibular angle and\nit's usually called the gonial angle\nbecause it comes from the facial point\nbegonian they found that the average\nattractive women's jaw has an angle of\n123 degrees with a 1st add a deviation\nof about 121 to 127 degrees\nthis result has high statistical\nsignificance when compared to the\nhealthy women with an average angle of\n116 degrees we just touched on the jaw\nappearing squared and the researcher\nshows that the comparison between a\nhealthy and attractive women where the\nattractive woman has a jaw that is\nsomewhat resembling more of iman's\nShoreline where it's not too steep or\ntoo flat and the healthy or the average\nwoman has a jaw that is somewhat\nresembling a more square shape we can\nshow that a more Square jawline would\nlook like in iman's case and it's not as\nattractive as a normal jawline which he\nhas now and this is because it lessens\nher facial dimorphism or the femininity\nand her facial averageness\nso overall what can we say about iman's\njawline well she has a normal class 1\nocclusion and this means that her teeth\nare lined properly her jaw is also\nforward grown rather than downward grown\nand this is very important for facial\nattractiveness as it pulls the under jaw\nback very tightly and gives you the\nsharp jawline effect and this translates\nto her facial appearance in the frontal\nprofile as well which is also Pleasant\nand it makes her cheekbones really pop\nso if you have any doubts about your\njawline it's very recommended that you\nsee an orthodontist they're very\nmisunderstood but they basically\nspecialize in helping you become more\nattractive by correcting your facial\nbone structure\nwhile Iman has many other attractive\nfeatures the last two of noteworthy ones\nare her eyebrows and the overall brow\nregion in our video sexy vs beautiful\nappearances we take a look at research\nby Joan zatel detailing how women use\nCosmetics to exaggerate sexual\ndimorphism in the brow area to contrast\nand to increase apparent youthfulness\nmon already has dark and full eyebrows\nso not only is this a sought after trait\namong models but it's also making her\nface look more youthful and attractive\nbecause we tend to lose the darkness of\nour eyebrows as we get older a brow\nregion is also quite feminized where the\nangle between the glabella or the base\nof the forehead and the nose also called\nthe nasophrontal angle is quite obtuse\nthis is within a normal range but\ncarries more to the sexual dimorphism\nidea than a typical female face meaning\nit's within the upper end of the

Explained"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "the Bold glamour filter is driving\npeople on Tik Tok a little bit crazy\nright now and the scariest thing about\nthis filter well scary depending on how\nyou look at it is that users can run\ntheir hands over their face and the\nfilter appears yet so seamless and\nrealistic this is because you know just\nto get into it very quickly unlike other\nfilters which put on a mask over the\nface this filter uses generative\nadversario networks to basically change\nevery single Pixel of the face much like\nhow face app has been doing it for the\nlast 10 years but this isn't a machine\nlearning or AI Channel we're going to be\ntalking about the aesthetic changes from\nthe postfilter to the pre-filters and\nwhat this does to make the face more\nattractive the first thing you may\nnotice is that generally the skin\ntexture of the post filter videos are\nconsiderably smoother and more\nhomogeneous than before homogeneity in\nthe skin is very important because it is\none of the criteria as we covered in our\nprevious videos on skin that makes\nattractive facial features the color of\nthe skin is never as important as the\nundertone and the evenness of the skin\nand so when we say somebody has a nice\nskin complexion we're really talking\nabout how smooth the skin looks and\nthat's what this filter is replicating\nif you want to achieve this in reality\nthe closest you can come is using\nquality Foundation to cover blemishes\nand redness that give the face an uneven\ncomplexion and also acne can be covered\nto some extent however the skin will\nstill appear bumpy regardless of the\ncoverage of the redness or the skin\nitself so skin care again is almost\nessenti potential to minimize skin aging\nor reduce acne breakouts because\nrealistically you cannot have this level\nof smooth skin with just makeup alone\nhaving a specialized dermatologist take\ncare of your skincare routine is a good\nstart but generally you want to make\nsure if it's a bacterial infection of P\nacne vulgaris then you treat it with\nantibiotics or maybe even tretinoin we\nmade videos on this on how to have clear\naesthetic skin and all the research that\ngoes behind tronoid use and antibiotic\nuse for acne in these past videos so now\nmoving from the top down one of the\nsignificant differences is that the\neyebrows differ in shape and in color in\nthe pre-filter and postfilter videos as\nfor the shape of the eyebrows they're\nmade more arched and elevated which give\nthe eyes a more attractive and\nexpressive gaze it has been shown in\nprevious Studies by Alex that elevated\neyebrows are considered more attractive\nfor this reason brow lifts are a way to\nachieve more elevated eyebrows which do\nincrease the distance between the brow\nand the eyelid especially in women and\ntherefore give a more attractive eye\nelevation for this case note that in men\nhowever the eyebrows are lowered which\nis an important distinction because this\nfilter does give two different set of\nchanges depending on if you're a male or\na female and this is one of the great\nthings about generative adversarial\nnetworks in that they make you look like\na more handsome version of yourself\nrather than trying to make you look like\na more handsome version of someone else\nas for the eyebrow color we notice that\nit's darkened in the post filter video\nwhich is common for both men and women\nbecause darker eyebrows are a sign of\nYouth if you look at your your\ngrandparents you'll notice that they\nhave much lighter eyebrows which is\nsomething that naturally happens with\naging the eyebrows are also looking more\ndefined as you can use a brow pencil or\nbrow powder to contour and draw the\nBrows borders much like you see in the\nfilter and filling in the gaps with\npencil or powder that is one to two\nShades Darker than your natural brow\ncolor will help it give more fullness\nmuch like you see in the filter moving\non you'll also notice that the eyes look\nmore stretch which makes the face look\nmore attractive and Charming as you'll\nnotice that for both men and women they\ntend to typically have larger eyes\nwithin proportion and what this means is\nthat for women they have rounder but\nlarger eyes like think of Bambi or D\neyes and for men they have narrower but\nwider eyes much like again I use the\nexample of the Bugatti Chiron where the\neyes are wide and narrow but still very\ndimorphic and masculine but nonetheless\nquite large specifically the outer\ncorner or the canthus of the eyes are\nmore elevated and facing upwards rather\nthan downwards this eye stretch can be\nachieved either through Botox or through\nmanual adjustment of the hair\ncombination of eyeliner eyeshadow and\nmascara do accentuate the eyes and give\nthem the larger more attractive look\nwhich is the whole point of using winged\neyeliner for example for making the eyes\nlook more stretched out on that note\naccording to Cunningham paper more\nattractive women would have typically\nlarger foreheads larger eyes and wider\nset eyes as these are features of more\nneotenous facial characteristics\naccording to Quan in his book classic\nmakeup and Beauty drawing an edgy\neyeliner can add to the eye stretch and\nmake the eyes bigger eyeshadow increases\nprominence and mascara elongates and\ndarkens the eyelashes which in turn\nagain make the eyes look larger so\nperhaps you're seeing the pattern here\nin that the larger eyes within\nproportion and shape do look more\nattractive and that's what the filter is\nemulating you can use highlighter on the\neyelid below the eyebrow and at the\ncorners of the eyes to make those appear\nlarger and if you combine the use of\nfiller or makeup to lift the eyebrows\nwith the highlighter on the eyelid it\nwill add more space and illumination to\nthe eyelid area which will enhance the\nprominence of those features you may\nalso notice that the Tik Tok filter\nmakes the nose look smaller more defined\nand contoured using Shades Darker Than\nThe Skin shade and they do this for both\nmale and female by using bronzer or a\nsmall steady brush and a contouring\nstick which is two to three Shades\nDarker than your typical skin tone you\ncan Contour the edges of the notes on\nthe right and the left by drawing two\nlines downwards while leaving a light\nline in between this technique makes the\nnose look smaller and more finely shaped\nwhich does give Harmony to the face\nbecause there are certain proportions\nwithin which a nose looks best and this\napplies to many different racial groups\nand ethnicities now after contouring and\nblending the lines on the nose you can\nadd highlighter all the way down to the\nbridge of the nose right to the tip\nwhich creates an illusion of a Slimmer\nand more structured nose and enhances\nthe facial architecture besides makeup\nrhinoplastic can reshape the nose and\nmake it Slimmer correcting any bumps on\nits septum decreasing the size of the\nnostrils elevating the tip and many more\ncharacter characteristics depending on\nthe certain shape and modifications that\nyou desire and as we've explained in the\npast in this video not all no shapes\nlook good on all people if you're of say\nAfrican descent you certainly don't want\nto eurocent your nose but that being\nsaid there are still things everyone can\ndo to make their nose look more\naesthetic because again we're all human\nand noses do follow proportion and\nstructure rules just like any other\nfacial characteristic one of the most\nstriking things about the filter is that\nit makes a cheekbone look significantly\nmore prominent which is why most people\ntend to look good using this filter\nunless they have a very masculine face\nalready in which case it makes the face\nlook too masculine and too Over the Top\nIf your cheekbones are at the lower part\nof your nose then you typically have low\ncheekbones and if they're directly\nunderneath the eyes close to where the\nbridge of the nose begins then you have\nhigh cheekbones using contouring\ntechniques you can increase the\ndefinition and prominence of the\ncheekbones much like the filter does as\nwell you can use breath to suck in the\ncheeks making the cheekbones visible and\nthen Contour them this gives color\ncontrast between the cheeks and light\nunder the eyes and makes the face have\nwider more prominent cheekbones and\ntherefore look more attractive\nadditionally cheekbone lifting\nprocedures such as fillers and fat\nrestoration on the cheeks can rebuild\nthese youthful structures which the\nfilter is trying to emulate and using\nfillers in the right place will make the\ncheeks more noticeable and wider on the\nside of the cheeks which will create\nthat Hollow model look in the scientific\nliterature this is called pseudo zaga G\natic projection where you're basically\nmaking the cheeks wider to make the\nValley of the cheeks look deeper one\nspecific technique is applying dermal\nfiller injected peroy over the zygomatic\nArch or the cheekbone that goes all the\nway back to enhance the facial Contour\nthis will result in high arch cheek burs\nwhich are more of what we're seeing in\nthis filter rather than just typically\nhigh and prominent cheekbones overall\ncheekbone injections and makeup\ncontouring will rebuild a well contoured\nprojector cheek and therefore a more\nyouthful and attractive face some\ncelebrities have also used Buckle fat\nremoval procedures to achieve that\nmodess cheekbones but this is not\nsomething we recommend and we actually\ndid a full video on why we don't\nrecommend getting Buckle fat removals to\nget the look that you see in the filter\nthe lips are a feature that everyone's\nmostly familiar with whether by using\nmakeup or lip fillers this is something\nthat the filter makes very obvious we\ncan notice that the filter increases the\nsize and gives them a nicely plumped\nsymmetrical shape with the pronounced\nCupid's bow on top which gives the lips\na more shapely and attractive look you\ncan undergo lip augmentation by lip\nfillers or with a lip liner you have to\nbe very careful with lip fillers to not\nget into over filling syndrome where\nyour lips take on more filler than they\ncan handle and also lip filler can\nmigrate which doesn't really look good a\nmoderate amount of lip filler that\nmatches your facial features can be\ninjected without overdoing it or looking\ntoo plump but again you have to be very\ncareful with this particular section as\nfor the lip liners you can draw your\nlips starting 1 to 2 mm above the the\nContour of the lip which gives the\nillusion of bigger and Fuller lips and\nthis will also increase facial contrast\nwhich is the difference in skin color\nand tone between the facial features\nsuch as the eyes lips and eyebrows and\nthe surrounding skin which the Bold Glam\nfilter essentially does lip liner also\ndemarcate so it makes the lips look\nlarger by making the Vermillion line\nmuch more clearer which is where the\nredness of your lip ends and the skin\nbegins and essentially makes the lips\npop one word of warning for the lips\nespecially is some people just don't\nhave the right lip shapee some people\nhave lip Vermilion so the red part of\nthe lip that goes downwards rather than\nforward and outwards and so adding more\nfiller won't give you the look that\nyou're really hoping for if you're part\nof the first group and if that's the\ncase then don't add more and keep\nexpecting those results just call it\nwhat it is accept it and move on to\nanother feature that you can do more\nwork and improve in the filtered videos\nthe teeth are whitened which is quite\nclear to see according to Lang vardos\nand his partner study lightness of the\nteeth does indeed positively affect\nsmile attractiveness and upper lip\ndistances were strongly associated with\nattractiveness as well dental care and\nwhitening increase the Harmony and\nattractiveness of the smile and does\nhelp to brighten the face by again\nadding contrast but the main reason for\nwhy we don't like yellow teeth is\nbecause of something called disease\naversion Theory where generally if\nsomething is yellow or stained we tend\nto associate it with disease especially\nfor whatever reason the color yellow\nwhich is what happen when your teeth\nbecome not white basically and with that\nis more or less how you would replicate\nthe effects of the beauty filter on your\nface in real life but we can't really\nend the video without talking about why\nyou probably shouldn't do that in the\nfirst place the impact of the filter on\nyour mental health to which we could\ndevote I suppose a whole video in the\npast we made videos on Zoom dysphoria\nand Snapchat dysphoria where filters\nfrom Snapchat and zoom caused more\npeople to be un upset with the way that\nthey looked and increased the amount of\nsurgical and cos procedures that were\nbeing done and which isn't necessarily a\nbad thing because we all want to look\nbetter but the problem was they were\ngetting the wrong procedures done\nbecause of the filters the insecurities\nwere ultimately needlessly in the wrong\nplaces when people consume social media\nfilters they implicitly get told that\ntheir unfiltered face isn't desirable or\ndoesn't satisfy beauty standards and on\nthis channel we acknowledge that there\nare beauty standards and you will be\ntreated differently based on your\nphysical attractiveness but not everyone\nconsents to wanting to look better not\neveryone has to look better not\neverybody has to pursue getting that 10\nout of 10 face because it doesn't apply\nto their job or their lifestyle Beauty\nfilters ultimately negatively impact a\nuser's self-esteem by making them\ncompare themselves to an altered video\nof someone else and in fact many users\nwho have used the Tik Tok bold glamour\ndiscussed in other videos that they have\nquestionable feedback stating that they\nfeel unattractive after removing the\nfilter in this example the girl says\nthat she was humbled quickly after\nremoving it as she felt that her natural\nunfiltered face is not worth showing off\nand is not enough which is a common\nresponse that I've seen from a lot of\npeople and understandably this filter is\nhyper exaggerated it is not realistic\nand it's not something you would\nrealistically be able to pull off at\nleast in the long run it's like wearing\nmakeup you don't go to sleep in your\nmakeup the most Insidious part of this\nfilter is well something called the mere\nexposure effect or the familiarity\neffect which suggests that repetition or\nfamiliarity augment positive emotional\nreactions towards a particular stimulus\nso in this example with the filter and\nits effects on Lower self-esteem the\neffect eventually leads to filters users\ngetting familiar with the edited face\nafter noticing the attractiveness boost\nit has added to their face and so if you\nlive the LIE long enough you start to\nbelieve that this is what you should\nlook like according to posac and\ncolleagues many other authors have\nsuggested that media images of\nattractiveness may be responsible for\nthe normative discontent among young\nwomen regarding their own appearances\nand body weights if you look at this\ngraph on girls mental health issues\nyou'll notice that the timing in the\nrise of mental illness is correlated\nwith the rise of social media and Tik\nTok filters are really only going to\nexacerbate the issue as we've seen right\nnow but that being said the filters\naren't all bad because if they were all\nbad we wouldn't really be using them\nthey do have some utilitarian value in\ngiving you some direction in how you can\nimprove your looks and arguably the\nfilters do make a lot of faces look\nbetter that's because by increasing\nsexual dimorphism so making the men look\nmore masculine and the women look more\nfeminine which is what the filter is\nultimately doing it does make people\nmore attractive and we've covered the\nresearch on this so many times that\ndimorphism is to a degree linked with\nphysical attractiveness then it's not a\nbad idea to follow some of the advice of\nthe filter which is you know having\nclearer skin having wider teeth they're\nnot necessarily bad things and we can\nall agree that those things do make you\nmore attractive so if that's the case\ntake it with a grain of salt and use it\nto help guide your journey but don't\nmake it the end all and be all or what\nyou should be looking like because the\nfilters are ultimately Ai and from a\ntechnical perspective AI is not the\nperfect representation for what you will\nlook like if you do those exact things\nthat we've outlined in this video you\nwill look actually very different that\nbeing said if you want to learn more\nabout your physical facial features and\nyou want to learn about how you can\nimprove the way that you look with a\nunderstanding calm guided

Face"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "while it may seem pedantic trying to\ndissect differences between a beautiful\nand well a sexy face there are actually\nsome subtle differences that make this a\nvalid discussion people often point to a\nface they consider sexy and that face\ntends to look different from a face that\npeople Lord as being beautiful the\ndifference is actually in the wording\ncalling somebody sexy or hot has a\nlustful connotation behind it it\nsignifies sexual attraction a sexy face\noften appears seductive or sultry on the\nother hand a beautiful person captures\nfacial proportions and features that can\nbe admired without appearing seductive\nif we take a painting by Van go most\npeople will recognize it as beautiful\nsimply due to its artistic nature luster\nof the colors pop and every fine brush\nstroke is a testament to that artist's\ncreative power you could stare at that\npainting for hours noticing all the fine\ndetails but a beautiful human in a\nsimilar way can be likened to a painting\nit follows tenants of artistic design\nthat we all tend to like\nmost of us can recognize and admire a\nbeautiful face after all according to\ngallop and fedick beauty is largely\nobjective there is little cross-cultural\ndisagreement on what makes a beautiful\nface our evolutionary history drives\nthat consistency a beautiful person does\nnot necessarily have to look perfect\nthough arguably subtle imperfections can\nadd to the uniqueness and beauty of a\nface and that is where the subjectivity\nof beauty comes into play so it is a mix\nof both objective and subjective\nstandards no amount of staring at a\nbeautiful beautiful face would elicit\nthe same sexual draw that staring at a\nsexy face does however there is some\noverlap between the two terms a sexy\nface can of course be considered\nbeautiful to some extent and the\nopposite can also hold true still though\na face that is considered sexually\nattractive will display different facial\nfeatures on average so let's try to do a\ndeeper dive into what separates somebody\nfrom looking hot compared to looking\nbeautiful when we talk about a face\nbeing sexually attractive we are\nalluding to physical attraction and more\nso sex appeal the there is a hardwired\nbiological component to sexual\nattraction that intends to reproduce\nwith a healthy mate a large proportion\nof appearing like a healthy mate is\nsexual dimorphism having characteristics\nthat Express the prototypically\nmasculine or feminine face can cue into\nsexual maturity and reproductive\ncapability in men this could be having\nfacial hair a strong jaw a prominent\nbrow Ridge a larger nose thus a sexy\nmale face would have an intermediate\namount of facial hair to not cover up\nthe robustness of the jaw a sexy female\nface would have upturned eyebrows\nsmaller nose Fuller lips longer hair and\nof course there are bodily features as\nwell for both of the Sexes but that's\noutside the scope of the discussion an\nandrogynous face could be considered\nbeautiful but may lack a high degree of\nsex appeal a simple test to discern\nwhether a face is hot or beautiful is to\nsee how people describe it if people\ndescribe it in irrated ways and point to\nsexual desirability then it is likely\nmore of the sexual face with high\ndimorphism these Compliments are often\nless refin find and there is a little\nmention of desirable personality traits\npersonality is often an afterthought for\na sexy face however a beautiful face May\nelicit compliments outside of their\nlooks they may be related to the looks\nthemselves but it could also be\nsomething like your eyes have a warm and\nkind appearance but that has nothing to\ndo with the face itself what does kind\neyes even mean I me think about it\nmoreover this becomes apparent for any\nattractive actor athlete musician\nactress and so be it the actor will be\ncomplemented on their personality and\nacting skills along with their beauty in\nfact for the cases of actors like\nMichael B Jordan His onscreen Persona\nboosts his perceived Beauty research by\nlittle and colleagues knowe what is good\nis beautiful a common stereotype that\nthey're trying to discover and male and\nfemale participants in their study were\nasked to create composite faces of their\ndesired partner's personality what they\nfound in that study was that the\nattractiveness of the composite faces\ndepends on the person's personality\ntrait preferences for example example\nwomen appear to demand partners that\nlook sexy assertive mature relaxed and\nwarm men did not discriminate as much\nbut appearing easygoing assertive warm\nand sexy were significant in a female\npartner what somebody considers\nbeautiful can depend on the trait they\nvalue in a partner and sexiness was just\none of those variable traits however it\nis noteworthy that both men and women\nseem to Value sexiness or sexual\ndesirability when it comes to trait\npreferences so there is an overlap the\nimportant takeaway is that a face can be\nbeautiful without being the most sexy if\nthat person prefers an assertive and\neasygoing face then what would be\nbeautiful to them is different sexiness\nseems to be its own Dimension and is not\ncompletely synonymous with\nattractiveness or beauty Chris Evans was\nrecently named the sexiest man alive but\nwe can even increase his sex appeal\nthrough subtle changes in skin tone\neyebrow color and facial shapes even the\nhead position makes a difference as\nwe'll see later that does not\nnecessarily mean he is more beautiful to\neveryone some of his other traits like\nperceived kindness May diminish at the\ncost of increased sex appeal another\nprominent example is Michael B Jordan\nwho doesn't have the most harmonious\nface as we've covered in our analysis\npreviously but he has high sex appeal\nbecause of his onscreen Persona as a\nmusclebound athlete in Creed for example\na common Trend among sexy faces is that\nthey tend to look more Fierce the\nprevious study by litland colleague\nseems to emphasize assertiveness and\nsexiness as the most significant traits\nand the two may actually be Inseparable\nbut more research should be done to\nconclusively say that a beautiful face\ncould be described as kind approachable\nlikable elegant even sophisticated a\nsexy face is often described as hot\nFierce robust striking assertive\nmemorable so what makes a face appear\nfierce in numerous past videos we've\ndescribed the various facial proportions\nlike the facial WID to height ratio that\ncue into perceptions of dominance in\nother words having a wide and short face\ntends to make a face look more\naggressive much like the headlights of a\nBugatti study however there are other\nfeatures that make a face appear Fierce\nangularity and robustness is actually a\nbig one this applies to the angularity\nof the jaw the cheekbones eyes and\neyebrows any objects that are angular\nare perceived as more capable and\ndominant than rounded ones for research\nby Barry and MacArthur sexy faces tend\nto have more angular and sharp eyebrows\nthis gives a striking appearance and a\nrounded brow shape we can make a male\nface less sexy in Photoshop do changes\nin facial angularity and dimorphism\nwe'll also touch on the eyebrows in just\na second but all of these changes give\nsomeone like Ian somala a less sexy\nappearance and this would surely affect\nhis type casting and how he is perceived\nas not a handsome vampire but more just\nan average Joe it's not enough to make\nhim unattractive but the changes do\ndetract from a specific niche of sexual\nappeal research by vodka atal\ninvestigated the effect of sagittal head\nposition so how much the head is tilted\ndown or back on the attractiveness of\nthe eye region first it was noted that\nby tilting the head down by 50 ° the\neyes appear more upturned and angular\nand you can test this in front of the\nmirror yourself just till your head down\nand look at yourself look into your eyes\nand you'll notice that your face does\nlook more intimidating much like you're\nready to fight so not only does a\nnegative sagittal head position increase\nthe pleasantness of the under eye region\nin by pleasant we mean attractiveness by\nmaking it look more aggressive strong\ndominant but it also accentuates the\nangularity of the eyes this is why\nmodels typically tilt the head down\nslightly if you've ever noticed and and\nit's a more dominant aesthetically\npleasing and seductive posture if you\nwant to appear sexier that is one way\ndon't overdo it please the color and\ncontrast of the eyebrows also tie into\nsexual dimorphism thus they affect how\nsexier face appears a paper by Jones\natal discusses the various facial\ncontrast that affect how sexually\ndimorphic and attractive a face appears\nof particular note was the difference in\nbrow contrast between men and women more\neyebrow contrast is a masculinizing\ntrait this takes a form of dark and\ndense eyebrows and this is why glasses\nwith dark rims can often appear sexy\nespecially on people with lighter\ncomplexions conversely thinner and\nlighter brows with less contrast are\nless sexually dimorphic for women\nhowever less brow contrast is also\ntypical in older faces so it's a sign of\nAging as well looking old is usually not\nconsidered sexy so there is a trade-off\nbetween Youth and femininity when it\ncomes to female eyebrows TR like Vigor\nand energy are also associated with\nusefulness and so darker and more\ncontrasted eyebrows seems to benefit\nboth men and women this is why a sexy\nface usually has dark eyebrows and more\ncontrast around their eyes virtually any\nexample you can take has pretty thick\nstrong eyebrows the effect of contrast\non attractiveness and dimorphism was not\nas profound in the mouth or other areas\nof the face this is why makeup is mostly\naround the eyes because they have a\ngreat influence in how sexy a face\nappears perhaps even the greatest\ninfluence it's why making the brows and\nlashes darker with makeup tends to make\na face appear more vigorous and Youthful\nit can make a face that is predominantly\nbeautiful into a sexier face through\nsubtle changes in facial angularity but\nmainly through increased contrast in the\nlashes and the Brows so to sum up there\nare subtle differences between a sexy\nface and a beautiful face I think we can\nall come to agree a sexy face typically\npossesses more markers of facial\ndimorphism you know more masculinized or\nmore feminized characteristics typically\ntending towards the more masculine\ncharacteristics in the west where want\nsharper features on both men and women\nand more feminized characteristics in\nthe East where even the men have softer\nmore pretty boy features but nonetheless\nthey're just two sides of the same coin\nalso someone who looks sexy usually\nlooks Fierce their faces are more\nangular and they tend to have darker\neyebrows and higher contrast around the\neyes appearing sexy seems to be its own\nsubcategory among the many traits that\npeople look for in a face just like with\nany other sexual appeal like for the\nbody shape your bodily features your\nheight while it is important other\ntraits like appearing easygoing also do\nmatter from the studies we looked at and\nin short sexual desirability suly\ncaptures what makes a sexy face think\nshort-term attractiveness we typically\ntend to look for sexier Partners\nlong-term Partners we tend to look for\nmore beautiful Partners a beautiful face\ncan be likened to a painting it\nexpresses just the right traits that

however\nafter switching the brown eyed bases to\nnow having blue eyes brown eyes actually\ndid not have an effect on perceived\ntrustworthiness but rather it maybe that\nPedro has certain ages that tend to come\npackaged with brown eyes or people who\ncome from geographies that have brown\neyes and those increase its\ntrustworthiness not the brown eyes\nthemselves like we expressed in this\nvideo the color of the eyes is very\narbitrary it's the features of the eyes\nthat make the actual Aesthetics some of\nthese features that the paper notes are\na broader chin eyebrows that are closer\nto one another a bigger nose and a\nbigger mouth and Pedro actually\npossesses most of these traits so why do\nthese more robust facial features seem\nto come packaged with brown eyes the\nresearchers offer some explanation in\nthe form of biosocial adaptation and\nevolutionary based hormonal influence\nthough they note that more research\nshould be done to actually find out what\ncauses the increased trustworthiness in\nbrown eyed faces is it just the eye\ncolor that the shape or is it the\nfeatures overall either way Pedro has\nbrown eyes and the associated facial\nshapes that give him a more trustworthy\nappearance Recent research in 2022 by\nsiringu and colleagues emphasizes the\nimportance of the eyes in impressions of\ntrust they noted how participants\nincreased the contrast between the pupil\nto Iris and the sclera or the white of\nthe eyes when attempting to make a face\nmore trustworthy we can alter Pedro's\neye contrast in Photoshop and see that\nthis changes his impressions of\ntrustworthiness we can demonstrate this\nin two ways the first we see that making\nthe whites of his eyes brighter seems to\ngive him a more trustworthy and vibrant\nappearance the second way is that we can\nchange the color of his Iris to increase\nor decrease the contrast with the rest\nof his face with darker eyes Pedro\nappears more trustworthy and with\nlighter eyes it appears less trustworthy\nFederal is right in the middle his brown\neyes already have the high scleral\ncontrast of the paper makes note of but\nthis perhaps gives him that more homely\nand trustworthy appearance and if you\nthink of His Last of Us casting Ellie\nseems to exclusively trust Joe and a lot\nof the casting is based around trust you\ndon't trust him in an apocalyptic\nscenario it's kinda hard to survive\nwhile that also certainly has to do with\nhis personality the facial appearance\nhas to correspond it's not by\ncoincidence that he was chosen for this\nrole and his nature Joel is a\ntrustworthy character to those he loves\nbut at the same time he has to display\nemotional impenetrability and\nruthlessness Pedro's mixture of facial\nfeatures displays that well the contrast\nwith the white sclera is a uniquely\nhuman trait that facilitates\ndiscrimination of Gay's Direction and\nallows individuals to guess where other\npeople are looking at or their\nintentions other research by todorov\nshowed brown eyed people are perceived\nas happier and less shy than blue-eyed\nindividuals in consistent with finding\nshowing that trustworthy faces are\nlinked to positive emotions and so yes\nthe puppy dog look may be a very real\nthing and something about Brian eyes do\ngive off the more cheerful and\ntrustworthy oppression\nPedro Pascal is Chilean and so his\ncharacteristically Hispanic noise is one\nof the most defining facial features\nwhile there are variations when it comes\nto Hispanic rhinoplasty Pedro has the\nmost common nasal characteristics a\nslightly downturned nasal tip a\nprominent dorsum and nasal bridge and a\nwide interalo width basically a wide\nnasal base this adds character and\nmasculinity to the face a paper by\nAndrea settle investigated sexually\ndimorphic differences in the Chilean\nnose in other words what is different\nabout the male nose when compared to the\nfemale one in the Chilean population\nmost of his assessments there were\nsignificant differences Pedro\ndemonstrated nearly all of those\ndimorphic differences where first\nPedro's base with or the width of his\nnose is quite wide his nasophrontal\nangle is right about average with the\nmale Chilean sample and so he doesn't\nhave an incredibly masculineized brow\nand upper nasal region still his other\nnasal features point to a highly\ndimorphic masculinized nose and his\nnasion is incredibly projected and his\nnose creates a low densenable angle of\naround 90 degrees overall this adds to\nan aura of maturity and competence that\nallows him to play a character like Joel\nadjusting his nose to be more pretty in\nboth the front and side profile actually\ntakes away from that believability of a\nmature character kind of like the nose\nof a child especially in a real-life\nadaptation these subtle changes in\nfacial features help the viewers\nimmersion even video game Joel had some\nruggedness and Mild imperfections to his\nnose\nthose Photoshop changes are simply done\nby feminizing the nose parameters\ndescribed in andreas's paper by simply\ncomparing it to what the female Chilean\nnose looks like Pedro's Face seems to\nbenefit from the rugged and prominent\nnodes similarly we can alter the\nparameters on the front profile where a\nnarrow nose with a less prominent nose\nbridge and dorsum just doesn't add the\nsame distinctiveness to the face and\neven his subtle nose asymmetries do add\ncharacter his widered nose shape also\nharmonize as well with this wide bone\nstructure while research on gray hair\nfacial attractiveness and social\nperceptions all in one is quite\ndifficult to come across there are some\nimplications in research done by Huang\nand rompolis Wang references a study by\nZhang and colleagues of 2020 where they\ntry to resolve the long-standing concern\nthat psychological stress creates gray\nhair if this is true this could relate\nto Pedro's portrayal of Joel Joel lives\nquite a stressful life in a\npost-apocalyptic zombie-ridden world so\ngray hair often denotes wisdom maturity\nor generally having been and seen a few\nthings additionally video game Joel has\ngray hair and it immerses us more into\nthat world Zhang did find the mechanism\nby which stress can cause graying\nmelanocyte stem cells produce the\npigment during the hair follicles\nregeneration cycle when stressed the\nadrenal glands release No adrenaline\nthese stem cells reside and then they\nstart to deplete the hair growth that\nfollows lacks in color this is certainly\nquite interesting but it's not\nnecessarily a bad thing that Pedro has\nnotably gray hair in his late 40s in the\ncontext of playing Joe the slightly\nweathered appearance Works to its\nbenefit even in a general sense it makes\nit more dependable and competent and\ncertainly more mature so far all of the\nthings that we've discussed cue into how\nhis facial features relate to a higher\nlevel of maturity masculinity and\ntrustworthiness so that sets up the\nquestion why does it seem to be more\nattractive now than when he was younger\nyes some of that could certainly be due\nto the spotlight that he has given right\nnow and while Pedro is no stranger to\nthat the last of us is arguably his most\ncelebrated role however he also seems to\nbe aging into his looks as a younger\nactor Pedro had clashing facial\ncharacteristics on one hand his hollow\nbuccal region prominent nose and light\nbrows tend to make a face look more\nmature on the other hand he's near\nFlawless useful skin and lack of facial\nhair do the opposite so this\ningongruence makes him look a bit older\nthan he was at the time and now in his\nmature facial features they're matching\nup with his graying hair the fine facial\nlines and facial hair in fact it was\nalmost as if he was playing catch up\nwith his older off he now looks more his\nage whereas he looked older in his\nyounger roles so there you have it\nthat's what breaks down Pedro Pascal's\nappearance and a lot of it is just\naround trust and maturity he just looks\nlike a trustworthy father figure that's\nexactly what Joel is in his casting so\nif you want to learn more about your\nface now just like we broke it down for\nPedros well you can head over to the\ncrew's website and Order and facial\nassessment performed by a team of\ndoctors and dentists and learn more\nabout what you can do to improve the way\nthat you look and have a breakdown of\nyour face just like we did with Pedros\nas always that's over at the curves\nwebsite and I'll catch you in the next\none"}]}

Beauty Look"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "today on the channel we're going to be\ntaking a look at Monica Bellucci as per\npopular request you see Monica is what's\nconsidered the prime example of a face\nthat fits nearly almost all Western\nbeauty standards and it's not surprising\nthat she's renowned as having been one\nof the most classically beautiful faces\never Monica began her modeling career\nquite young at 13 and by her mid-20s had\nalready strung up an impressive modeling\nresume she signed with Elite Model\nManagement which is still quite a\npopular modeling agency even to this day\nand she has also done work for Dolce and\nGabbana and French l in that sense the\nItalian native had a generic Road into\nthe modeling and acting space she soon\nafter began acting and has received\nmultiple Awards and nominations winning\nthe European Golden Globe as one of them\nand her looks clearly play a large part\nin her Career Success especially with\nher roots in modeling who soon after\nwould be seen in men's health rankings\nof some of the most attractive women of\nall time and other lists of desirable\nwomen and not much has changed in that\nrespect where she even claims the title\nof the oldest Bond girl starring in the\nrole at 50 whereas some actors and\nactresses have a lot more subjectivity\nrevolving around their attractiveness I\ndon't think there is a whole lot of\ndebate as to whether Monica is\nattractive by Western beauty standards\nshe clearly fits the mold of a western\nBeauty icon and even by today's\nstandards her facial features and dental\nfacial morphology basically the bone\nstructure is not something that would be\nunexpected Monica has a high degree of\nfacial dimorphism meaning she looks\ntraditionally feminine a combination of\nfacial proportions and features give her\nthat traditionally feminine appearance\nand most glaring ones are full lips and\na small nose an exceptionally small nose\nis considered a neotenous or juvenile\nfacial feature and Monica's is quite\nslender and small in the frontal profile\nin the side profile it is harmoniously\nprojected and would not be classified as\ntoo large or too small of a nose as a\nwhole her nose is one of the definingly\nfeminine facial characteristics the\ngolden ratio of 1.618 is commonly used\nin defining facial Beauty and unsuitably\nso in some context on the channel we've\nmade many videos as to why the golden\nratio is a poor indicator of how\nattractive someone is and this ratio\nsimply doesn't apply to every facial\nfeature however in Monica's case the\nmouth width is just about 1.61 times\nwider than her nose width which does\nseem to align with the theory of the\ngolden ratio even though we don't really\nagree with that on the channel in this\nspecific instance the golden ratio has\nsome Merit to it but the idea is that\nthe mouth width and nose harmonize well\nwith one another where an overly small\nmouth or an overly thin nose is not\naesthetically pleasing a study by broad\nspot and left dag notes the classical\nproportions of the mouth being 1.5 times\nwider than the nose as a comparison\npoint in their research a plastic\nsurgeon would consider these types of\nproportional relationships as well as\nethnic variation of typical and\nharmonious nose shapes where viewing the\nnose in isolation would be a big mistake\nbeing male also throws this golden ratio\nidea out of the window because men just\nhave a lot of wider noses on average\nthat can still look good and for those\nreasons we don't really agree with the\ngolden ratio being used in Beauty\nresearch like a lot of other channels\ntalk about\nanother neotenous tray is having a\nsmaller narrower mouth despite Monica\nhaving a narrower mouth her mouth is\nstill considerably wider than her nose\nwhich shows just how slim her nose is\nher nose bits between the inner cancer\nor the inner corners of the eyes these\nare not hard fast rules for beauty but a\nlot of attractive faces do fit into this\nstandard and the idea here is that\nMonica has a feminine nose and mouth\nthat still harmonized well with her\nother facial features like her eye\nspacing as we can see there is some\norder to the arrangement of things on\nher face the really obvious facial\nfeature that contributes to her modeling\nand acting success are basically her\nhigh cheekbones and strong jawline the\nselection bias of high cheekbones and\nmodels and actresses has remained for\ndecades and probably even longer Monica\nhas exceptionally High zygomatic bones\nwhich really give her midface an\nuplifted youthful appearance we can see\nthat her cheekbones pop out really close\nto the eyes in both the front view and\nthe three-quarter profile and the\nmidface region especially the tissue and\nBone surrounding the eyes begin to\ntypically sag with age this is another\nreason why high cheekbones are\nattractive because they are a strong\nyouth indicator we've already touched on\nhigh cheekbones being a feminine\ncharacteristic that typically develops\nunder higher estrogen levels in women\nfor this video here and the secret to\nmodeling cheekbones facial Aesthetics\n101 the OG curve there is a trend here\nwhere Monika has an unmistakable\ncombination of youthful and both\nfeminine features\nand these are always going to be part of\nthat recipe that traditionally makes an\nattractive feminine face both by Western\nand Eastern beauty standards because\nthere is agreement between the two\ncultures as to what makes a face\nattractive and we can all agree that\nyouthfulness is something that applies\nto both men and women\nwith age we can also see Monica develop\nsome fine lines and other totally normal\nsigns of the aging process but the\nseverity of these symptoms of Aging do\nnot tie into the underlying bone\nstructure since Monica has that strong\nFoundation of high cheekbones her face\ndoesn't seem to be melting with age and\nthis is one of the core benefits of\nhaving stronger facial features just\nlook at Mass Mickelson who is much older\nbut also has very sharp facial features\nthat don't sink like fat and soft tissue\ndo the first area to notice loss of\nfacial volume is the under eye region as\nwe start to lose fat deposits and burn\nhere even though we don't see that in\nMonica as she progressively ages the\nzygomatic bones and the maxillary bones\nso the cheekbones and the upper jaw\nbones comprising her mid face still give\nher a youthful appearance even as she\napproaches 60 and all of that is because\nof strong bone structure the important\nthing to note is that Monica had and\nstill has to a degree useful facial\nfeatures because the dental facial great\nor the way that her face developed still\nlends itself to looking more youthful\nthan somebody who doesn't have those\nfeatures and the face really tends to\nSag playing into her mid-face bones her\nprominent facial growth also extends to\nher lower jaw her jaw structure is\naesthetically attractive by both\ncephalometric and orthodontic standards\nin other words we can measure and point\nout exactly why the jaw is attractive\nfirst it's lean she has a defined\njawline and that's step one for most\nfaces this in biology is called facial\nrobusticity as for the actual shape it's\nforward grown and not overly projected\nher jaw angle is around 123 degrees\nwhich is in the aesthetically desirable\nrange for women but it is more on the\nmasculine side we've already touched on\nMonica's facial femininity and\nyouthfulness but she has also some\nmature characteristics to her bone\nstructure as well the base is defined\nwith a sharp jawline a visible OG curve\nand angular bone structure\nthese are not juvenile traits not\nsomething you would see on a young\ninfant but rather ontogenous traits that\nmake her look more matured more like a\nwoman in fact some facial maturity\nespecially in the facial angularity\ndepartment is attractive for both men\nand women after all neither women or men\nwant to be judged as having childlike\ntraits like naivety or physical weakness\nfor the rest of their life most\nattractive faces have both youthful and\nalso matured facial features as an\nindicator an excerpt from the book love\nromance sexual interaction by Nathaniel\npallone displayed a study by marabian\nand Blum that note how useful and\nfeminine traits mixed in with mature\ntraits like prominent cheekbones are\nwhat makes women attractive the last\nmost identifiably attractive feature we\ncan talk about are her eyes where\nresearch by prantoletal found vertically\ntaller eyes with upturned and raised\neyebrows correlate with female facial\nattractiveness in summary an attractive\neye area was one that showed typically\nyouthful features like a lack of\nwrinkles or puffy eyes and the top rated\neyes had an average age of about 22\nyears old while the bottom rated eyes\nhad an average age of 59 years old so in\nthat sense Monica certainly fits that\nstandard as she has upturned eyes that\nwere also youthful in appearance when\nshe was of that age similarly researched\nby clatsby atal surveyed The public's\nopinion of eyebrow Aesthetics in one of\nthe highest ranked eye areas shown\nalmost look identical to Monica's eye\nand eye shape the findings of this study\nseem to run contrary to what is seen in\nplastic surgery literature interestingly\nenough the general public prefers\neyebrows in a lower position with a\nlonger lower eyebrow arch Monica's brows\nare in a relatively lower position while\nnot being overly masculinized or too\nclose to the eyes the Brows are also not\ntoo arched her eyes and eyebrows don't\ngive her an overly surprised angry or\naggressive appearance and would seem to\nbe the most pleasing eye area to the\ngeneral public another attractive and\nYouthful feature reverse is that her\neyebrows are also dense dark and filled\nin which are health indicators think of\ndense brows as being filled in and\nthickly settled as opposed to sparse and\nnon-existent brows it's also why a lot\nof women fill in their brows with a brow\npin dark and dense brows have a big\ngenetic component so in that case she is\nquite lucky in that sense not only does\nit add contrast to her eye area making\nit appear more striking but it also\nmakes the eyes look more youthful and\nsomething that we've already established\nin the past as being well an attractive\nfeature as we age the Brows also start\nto lose their density a youthful shape\nand more importantly their color and\ndarkness so you see you don't really\nhave to be a plastic surgeon to tell why\nMonica is attractive by Western beauty\nstandards she has high facial dimorphism\nmeaning that the face is very feminine\nit's facially very neotenous meaning\nthat it's youthful and she has defined\nbone structure meaning that it is very\nrobust where in the west we have a high\npreference for robust Sharp angular\nfeatures for both men and women and in\nthe East there is more of a preference\nfor softer more feminized features for\nboth men and women in that sense she\nchecks every box of conventional Western\nbeauty standards in what makes an\nattractive face we didn't touch on every\nsingle minor feature in this video but\nthe face can be summed up as\nconventionally and also scientifically\nattractive following what the research\nliterature says so if you'd like to get\nyour face assessed just like we broke it\ndown here in much more detail from our\nteam of doctors and dentists to discover\nwhether your face is traditionally\nmasculinized feminized what your\nfeatures mean and how you can improve or\nchange the way you look then you can\nhead over to the cruise website for a\nfacial assessment as always I'll catch\nyou in the next one"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Video Title: Are These Glowups Realistic? | Here's How They Did It"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "all right so in this video we're going\nto be looking at some glow ups as was\nsuggested by you guys from Tech talk and\nwe'll analyze whether they actually\nexperience a real transformation or they\nchanged a few things and had what we'd\nlike to call a grow up so the difference\nbetween a glow up and a grow up was\nexplained in this video and the names\nshould make it pretty obvious as to what\nthey are the first thing we should\nalways be considering when analyzing a\nglow up and to see if it's actually\ndoable in your case you know if you can\nfollow that advice is the age difference\nbetween the before and after pictures\nbecause I could say I had a glow up from\nthe age of 2 to 10 but that's not really\na glow up it's just growing up so it's\nnot a very logical argument and we can't\nreally take much advice from there the\nmajority of viral before and after\nTransformations you see on Tick Tock\nReddit and anywhere else online are just\nreally crawl UPS they're just people\ngrowing up going through puberty and\nsaying that they mute and they did this\nand that and you should buy their red\nlight therapy supplements and devices\nand you too can get those no they just\ngrew up guys come on please don't fall\nfor that okay so this is the first\ntransformation regarding the age\ndifference well we can't be very certain\nabout her age and the before and after\npictures but it appears that they're\nit's not a very big significant age\ndifference mainly because the facial\nfeatures are more or less the same and\nclearly the procrastination is not\nsolely due to a hair contrary to what\nshe's writing in the video first\nnoticeable change is in the skin in this\nbefore picture there's acne on her chin\nshakes and even forehead it's completely\ngone in the after picture her acne\nlikely improved and she probably used\nmakeup to cover the redness of the face\nalso Tick Tock filter it does seem\nthere's like there's a filter because we\nsee artifacts in the image itself tiktok\nfilters much like any other AI is not\nperfect it doesn't have 100 accuracy so\nthey leave behind little artifacts which\nare just pixels where they're not sure\nand those can be detected and that's why\nsome things just look filtered you know\nthey have that classic filtered look\nit's because of image artifacts an\ninteresting paper by Richard M Tims\nlooks at the results of acne and the\nimpact act and perception of acne on\nboth younger and more mature faces and\nthe results show that the clear skin\nfaces for both young and mature faces\nhad significantly higher ratings of\nattractiveness and were also perceived\nas more friendly sociable ambitious and\nhonest among other attributes for which\nclear skinned faces were rated more\nfavorably so the biggest change here in\nthe glow up is really just taking the\nphoto from a downward angle and taking\nit from in less downward angle and also\nhaving clear skin and using a better\nfilter she's also wearing glasses in the\nbefore clip which has been shown in many\nstudies to make people appear less\nattractive and in the after clip she's\nnot wearing glasses and also seems to be\nwearing lashes many studies such as\neyelashes and attraction published in\nthe Journal of vision explains that\neyelash length and fullness are\nsignificantly correlated with facial\nattractiveness she's also wearing makeup\naround the eyes which increases facial\ncontrast and again has been shown to\npositively impact racial attractiveness\nthe lips are also Fuller in the after\npicture but from what we can tell it\nseems to be because she's either closing\nor sucking in her lips in the before\nclip which makes them appear smaller the\nafter clipped her mouth is slightly open\nwhich creates the illusion of Fuller\nlips and additionally she seems to have\nadded some lipstick under the bottom lip\nand upper lip to enhance the fullness of\nthe Vermilion this is a relatively\naccessible glow up I wouldn't even call\nit a glob it's just moderate changes to\nher facial features that most people do\nanyway like when they're going out and\nit's pretty accessible for people to\nfollow one important piece of advice for\nanybody who does want to improve their\nappearance is to have a focus on the\nfoundation's first you know focus on\ngetting your clear skin getting your\nteeth hygiene your dental hygiene in\ncheck getting your hair and makeup and\nbodily features you know fat levels\nthose kind of things in Czech first\nbefore focusing on getting the right\ncheekbone and the right jaw size and\nthose irrelevant things which come later\non if you do have orthodontic\ndeficiencies like you have a very weak\njawline or you have sleep apnea then\nthat should be priority but again that's\nvery that's not all of you so for most\npeople focus on the foundations the\nbasics and you can get a pretty\nsignificant difference as we're seeing\nhere from just makeup lighting cosmetics\nand skin Health alone\nthe second one is a more significant\nglow up and there is a larger age\ndifference in the transformation in the\nleft we can say perhaps maybe 15 16 and\non the right maybe 23-24 because he's\ngot more of his adult features coming in\nbut nevertheless his features have not\nactually changed all that much so it's\nan interesting transformation to examine\nwhat makes the one on the right so much\nmore attractive the first noticeable\nchange is in the distribution of facial\nfat where his chin cheekbones and\njawline are much more defined and\nprominent in the after clip this\ntypically happens for most men as they\nfinish puberty and they finish up on\ntheir facial development where during\npuberty your face is really a blend of\nbaby and adult and it doesn't really\nlook as good as it should after when\nyou're you know a young adult\nis Jolene has a strong demarcating\nShadow basically it's the shadow that\noutlines the jawline which is what\nhappens when someone either loses facial\nfat achieves a stronger jawline just by\ngrowing or through Orthodontics or even\nthrough dermal fillers or implants\nbasically What's Happening Here is that\nthe jaw bones push against the skin so\nthe mandibular body and creates a\ntighter look with more facial Contour\nit's basically pulling the skin very\ntightly so that there is no more sagging\nand in this case he hasn't probably had\nany procedure to lose facial patches\nGeneral aging this is quite a common\nphenomenon as most people who have\nchubby cheeks as a teenager tend to lose\nthe Buckle fat pad and they shrink with\nage when they enter their mid-20s or\nwomen this is more common as they go\nfrom baby fat to what we like to call\nthe womanly face you know there's a lot\nof videos on that on Tick Tock and for\nmen this tends to happen a bit later at\naround 26 27 where they really come into\nthat manly masculine face this body fat\nlevels seem to have decreased as well\nand we can see his gained a significant\namount of muscle mass over the years Dre\nlay and colleagues in their paper the\ninfluence of body composition effects on\nmale facial masculinity and\nattractiveness have shown that more\nmuscle mass and less fat Mass increase\nperceived facial masculinity that make\nyou look more manly and increase facial\nattractiveness especially in short-term\ndating contexts the hairstyle has also\nchanged with longer hair on top which\nelongates the face and gives them a more\nbalanced look because he actually has a\nbit of a tall face his face is matured\nwhich is normal for his age and we can\nsee that he has a different facial\nexpression in the before and after which\nwe also have to consider by smiling he\ndoes seem more friendly approachable and\nalso happy and people do connect with\npeople that are happier rather than\nlooking like they're very miserable you\nguys also need to pay attention that the\nlighting is also different here there's\na flash in the second picture which has\na noticeable impact on the final look of\nthe picture and how the Shadows of the\njawline are reflected so by having soft\nLighting in the left and having harsh\nhiding in the right the base is much\nmore defined in the right because\nlighting is allowing it to be defined\nthis Tick Tock is obviously not the best\nfor doing any kind of analysis or even\nbefore and after comparison but I'm\nhappy for him that he managed to have\nthis glow up more correctly would just\nbe a grow up because I don't see any\nsignificant differences from the before\nand after this is the natural course\nthat his face would have taken had he\nnot really done anything to change it\nfor the third phase we notice a pretty\nbig difference in body fat levels in the\nvast majority of cases looking at only\nthe face does give a accurate enough\nidea of somebody's body fat when this\nhas been shown by Bennett cozy and\ncolleagues in their paper about facial\nadiposity attractiveness and health they\nalso found that women with an\nintermediate amount of facial fat are\njudged healthier and more attractive\nthan women with more facial fat or with\nextremely low levels of facial fat\nand Cali Catal 1998 found no reliable\nrelationship between your facial\nattractiveness the General Health which\nmeans that facial attractiveness in\ngeneral is more or less a perception we\nhave these perceptions of what we think\nis healthy and if you meet those\nperceptions of what we think is healthy\nwhether or not you are actually healthy\nthen you will be rated as attractive in\nthe case of this woman the face looks\nsignificantly Slimmer her cheekbones are\nmore apparent the facial Harmony is\nimproved and that the fat loss has\ngreatly contributed to the change in the\ntwo faces moreover her face appears more\nfeminine on the right in the before\npicture her facial fat also makes it\nlook wider squared and more masculine\nalthough there appears to be a filter on\nthe after picture we can also see that\nshe has better skin homogeneity and a\nmore even skin tone which again plays an\nessential role in skin attractiveness as\nwe've talked about many times adenosium\nshe also wears Lashes in the after\npicture and makeup around her eyes which\nmakes them appear bigger and more\nfeminine though colored contacts haven't\nreally been proven to increase\nattractiveness they definitely make your\nface more striking and interesting\nanother critical thing we notice is her\neyebrow fullness and definition when the\nbefore picture her eyebrows look thin\nalmost invisible and eyebrows are\nessential because they give structure to\nthe face and the ioe itself so you can\nimagine the eyes as being the picture\nand the eyebrows as the frame of the\npicture in fact Jean Xiao and colleagues\nfound that facial attractiveness is\ndirectly affected by the eyebrows itself\nand in her picture we can see that she's\nused makeup to make her eyebrows look\nmore dense defined and darker this\nincreases facial contrast and gives more\nstructure to the face and definitely\nimproves facial attractiveness you can\nalso notice that her nose looks\ndifferent in that it's less wide the\nnasal tip and nasal Bridge are also both\nthinner and this could be an optical\nillusion just because the face has\ngotten wider and older the things that\nwe thought were not in proportion\nautomatically fall into proportion just\nby the virtue of everything else around\nthe face changing if we look at those\npictures then we can clearly see that\nthe nose structure has changed and she\nmost definitely may have had a\nrhinoplasty but the noise is less wide\nthinner and more defined the nasal tip\nand Bridge are also thinner as well most\nrhinoplasty patients tend to refine\ntheir nose but also preserve their\ncultural identity and rhinoplasty is a\nprocedure that really needs to take into\naccount where the patient's background\nis from the desert Momo and colleagues\nexplain the process for black noses in\ntheir study where they use allo base\nresection to narrow a wide nasal base\nand nostril and also reduce the size of\nthe nostril itself then they use\nadditional sutures to narrow the nasal\ntip and place a cartilage so that the\ntip is pointier and so generally with\nblack noses if there is a rhinoplasty\ninvolved it involves making the nose\nnarrower and also making the nose\nslightly pointier within reasons we're\nnot making it too narrow and not making\nit two pointies so that it has some\nstructure to it\nin this example she's also using\nlipstick to make her lips look fuller\nand increasing facial contrast again\nmuch like all the other examples we've\nseen and finally we can tell from the\nbefore picture that that's generally a\nbadly taken picture and so it's not\nreally fair to compare the two from\ndifferent angles and lightings but\nnonetheless we can use that to talk\nabout how you can follow some of the\nadvice to have your own positive\nImprovement in your facial Aesthetics\nthat being said if you would like to get\nyour face assessed and learn about how\nyou can improve your facial features and\nthe way you look and feel your best and\nhave your sort of confidence restored\nthen order a coves aesthetic assessment\nfrom our team of doctors and dentists\nand have us walk you through what your\noptions are and where you can improve"}]}

acting\nskills his good looks unsurprisingly\ncontributed a lot to his success the\nfirst film of which he garnered a lot of\nattention was purple noon based on the\n1955 novel the talent in Mr Ripley and\nthere has even been an English remake of\nthis but Matt Damon doesn't exactly\ncapture the same attention that this\nrole demands so it's sometimes being an\nexceptionally good looking actor can be\nadvantageous and that's going to be the\ngist of what we're going to cover today\nit adds more believability to the\nFantastical and vicious stories where\nthe character has to be larger than life\nfor biopics or non-fiction works a less\ngood looking face adds realism but in\nfiction the story can often be so\nimaginative that you may as well add a\nhighly attractive face on top of that\nthat is a face that most people would\nnever see in their day-to-day life a\nface that is so attractive that is just\nover the top and on the opposite end a\nhighly attractive actor may not be able\nto play more practical roles they're\njust too good looking to be realistic\nlet's try to break down what makes Alan\nde la the sex symbol of his time and the\nfacial features that make him\nparticularly attractive perhaps his most\ndistinguishable facial feature are the\neyebrows the thickness and the shape of\nthe Brows are quite unique in that they\nare upturned but not to an extreme\ndegree generally you don't see this on\nmost men who tend to have more flatter\nbrows and this creates a less emotive\nappearance more expressionless and\nboring but at the same time his eyebrows\nare not so upturned that they resemble a\ncomic book super villain recent paper by\ntakanori Sino from Cairo University a\nleading University in Tokyo sought to\ndiscover what makes a face attractive\nthrough deep learning algorithms in\ntheir findings sexual dimorphism plays a\nhuge role in facial attractiveness\nsimply put having more masculine facial\nfeatures as a male tends to be favorable\nand vice versa more feminine for women\none of the highly sexy shoot dimorphic\nfeatures but in most men are actually\nthe eyebrows in that they're especially\nimportant for male facial attractiveness\nas men and women have very large\ndifferences in the shape thickness and\nthe sizing of the eyebrows and\nplacements as well though it's important\nto note that that particular study was\nlooking at just the thickness of the\nBrows as the variable factor for\nattractiveness but all of these play a\nrole in how masculinized the eyebrows\nwill appear Elan certainly has\nmasculinized eyebrows as they are close\nto his dark and thick eye region one\nproposed reason for why thick dark\neyebrows that are closer to the eyes are\nactually seen as more attractive is\nbecause of something called facial\nbuttressing which as our team's\nbiologist Simon groom explains in this\nvideo could be because of protecting the\nface from Human punches and blows from\nother weapons as early males used to\nfight a lot basically the more\nattractive the face is the greater the\nmasculine features and these masculine\nfeatures have a purpose in protecting\nthe face the bone keeps the face safe so\nin theory a highly masculinized face\nlike alons may actually be evolutionary\nbetter because it can take more blows to\nthe face without going down we can go as\nfar as to say even the thickness and the\nsize of the Brows can help soften the\nblow of a fist aimed at your eyes in\nabsorbing some of the force the eyebrows\nalso play another role where\nadditionally they're very important for\nfacial recognition in previous videos\nwe've touched on Research from giroudi\natal where the absence of eyebrows in\nfamiliar faces leads to a very large and\nsignificant disruption in AI facial\nrecognition we also see the same thing\nhappen to human recognition where\nuniquely identifiable and prominent\neyebrows are an attractive and not only\nattractive but defining characteristic\nfacial features that make up you so they\nmake the face stand out and at the very\nleast make you more memorable and in\nthis case alon's eyebrows are masculine\nand measurably attractive because they\nhave the right shape the size thickness\nthat make them the masculine\nquantifiable measure okay so let's talk\na bit more about masculine facial form\nbecause he is as we explained in the\nintro highly masculinized almost over\nthe top to the point of being fictitious\nnot real looking and these are coupled\nwith high indicators of health and youth\nin his role as Mr Ripley in purple moon\n25 year old Elon had no signs of visible\nmale pattern baldness which is quite\ntypical among men starting at their age\neven into his 80s he still has most of\nhis hair which is quite crazy when you\nthink about that 50 of men will undergo\nsome significant form of male pattern\nboarding the reason for why he was able\nto keep a lot of his hair could be\nbecause of genetics and Healthy\nLifestyles but pharmaceutical\ninterventions such as finasteride and\noxidor having a hair loss routine is\nalso common during this period so it\ncould be because of that he could have\nalso had hair transplants but\nnonetheless it's his money maker he\nneeds to retain his hair for as long as\npossible because loss of hair is a\nsignificant detractor in facial\nattractiveness because of something\ncalled the Young parent hypothesis you\nwant to learn more about that we have an\narticle on the website while that might\nseem intuitive of course you want to\nkeep your hair as long as possible a\npaper by Thomas cash sought to examine\nthe social effects of common male\npattern baldness and unsurprisingly\npattern baldness caused generally less\nfavorable Impressions including lower\nratings of physical attractiveness\njudgments of less desirable personal and\ninterpersonal characteristics and\nmisperceptions of age meaning you look\nolder though cash did note how the\nbaldness stereotype was reduced in\nstrength when controlling for facial\nattractiveness meaning that a very\nhandsome man with a handsome face\ndoesn't really get that negative of\nbeing bald in the same way that a less\nhandsome and attractive person does get\nthe negative of being pulled and so if\nyou put an attractive bald man next to\nan unattractive man with hair the social\njudgments would still probably favor the\nbald man in relation to alon's case his\nfull head of hair contributes to his\nperceived attractiveness at the very\nleast it is why he has retained his\nfacial attractiveness quite well over\nthe years it would have been less\nspatially attractive if he did show\nearly signs of male pattern baldness\nwhere Cash's paper has shown that the\nnegatives of being bald just don't\noutweigh the benefits of being patiently\nhandsome in elon's case he also doesn't\nhave any overly pronounced nasolabial\nfolds or dark circles globular creasing\nvirtually no wrinkles at that point and\nhe did have some earlier signs of aging\nbut that is very much in the normal\nrealm and nothing excessive which is why\nhe aged so well it could even be\npreferred in male skin to have slightly\nrougher less Supple baby-like skin\nproviding a benefit compared to having\nperfectly clear skin in combination with\nelan's defined bone structure he\neffectively had the mature face with\nyouthful features so having the face of\na well-defined man in his later years\nsay the 30s but the skin of somebody in\nhis 20s and 25s moving on when thinking\nabout face shape we generally want to\nconsider three things the overall length\nof the face relative to its width the\nshape of the jaw and the vertical thirds\nof the face this would give us generally\nenough information to classify a face\nsuch as a launch as pleasant or\nunpleasant altering any one of those\nfactors beyond normality can negatively\naffect the perception of facial\naverageness and facial attractiveness\nalone has an ideal face shape in regards\nto not being overly long or short being\nmore Square which is the masculine ideal\nwe can see how altering the chin and the\nforehead negatively impacts facial\nattractiveness even the most subtle\nchanges in mathematical averageness or\nproportionality impacts the perception\nof the face in that same vein alone also\nhas Pleasant facial dirt they're all\nabout the same vertical length and\nstrength too far from their standards\ncan make one part of the face look\noverly long relative to the rest and may\nalso clue into some dental facial\nabnormalities such as orthodontic issues\nfor example a closed bite may result in\na shorter jaw researchers have examined\njust this issue how do variations in jaw\nheight affect your perceived facial\nattractiveness and this was performed on\nboth idealized male and female faces and\nthat classical standard of equal facial\nthirds seems to be more or less very\nproportional and the preferred although\nfurther research by Narnia tal does\nconfirm it doesn't have to be precisely\none-third we are humans as long as no\nfacial turd is either too long or too\nshort and it's not perfect proportions\nrather a range of values that most human\nfaces you know the top third the middle\nthird and the lower third seems to fall\nunder and you want to be within that for\nyour racial group or your Geographic\npopulation and you can see how altering\nthe length of the nose again is not\nfavorable in a case like this lastly we\ncan examine the shape of his jaw alone\ndoesn't have the most squared or\nmasculinized jawline and we can\nappreciate how altering the shape of his\njaw gives him a more masculine\nappearance it also gives his face a\nsquared uniform shape as well however\nElon already has quite a prominent\njawline which is considered\ndentofacially ideal and what this means\nis that here has the correct proportions\nand angles if you were to ask an\northodontist a paper by force atal\noutlines what these ideals are or a\npleasant profile similarly researched by\nmulletar tries to determine whether a\nphoto of the side profile is enough to\ndetermine if a person has underlying\ndental problems such as a overbite or an\nunderbite and these are identifiable by\nusing landmarks that you can see in the\nside profile in simple speak it's easy\nto see if the jaw is misaligned by just\nusing the side profile itself and the\ndifference in the angles can be the\ndifference between a handsome side\nprofile or a not handsome side profile\nas that becomes apparent and if we\nperform what's known as a cephalometric\nanalysis which is basically taking these\nmeasurements of the side profile we can\nsee in elon's case that he passes many\nof the assessments and none of them\nreally go far away from the ideal that\nthoughts at all's paper laid out and he\nalso doesn't seem to have a severe Class\n2 or class 3 malocclusion basically he\ndoesn't have an underbite or an overbite\nhis bite looks very handsome and\npleasant to help you visualize this we\ncan use Photoshop to simulate what a\nchange in these points would be\nbasically by bringing the chin and the\nlower lip we can demonstrate what a\noverbite or a underbite would look like\nand conversely we can show that a severe\nunderbite is quite distinct from elon's\nnormal bite the face that he has now\nthese deviations from the ideal bite or\nthe orthodontic alignment throw off his\nfacial assessment and make his jaw look\noverly retruited or protrusive and\nrespectively they have an impact on his\nfacial aesthetic one such assessment is\nagain to his nasal facial angle which is\na measurement we can take to determine\nthe pleasantness in simple speak of his\nnose relative to the chip beforehand\nElon has a pleasant angle of about 31\ndegrees and this is normal for the\npopulation but after some modification\nin Photoshop we can see that his angle\nbecomes more acute now at 26 degrees and\nperhaps you can agree that this is less\nattractive this is just one of the many\nways that we can measure how handsome a\npreside profile is just simply by using\nwhat's expected as the normals for the\npopulation however what you can take\naway from this is that even a subtle\nfive degrees of difference in a facial\nprofile or a parameter is enough to\nchange how a handsome face-like alarms\nis actually perceived it becomes less\nattractive and additionally a beard can\nbe suitable for a face like alons\nbecause he has a proportionate face so\nhe can sport almost any facial hairstyle\nor hair and make it work it also adds\nfacial dimorphism to his lower third by\nmaking it look more masculine and so\nthere you have it that's what makes Elon\ndelon's face attractive it's really a\ncombination of otherwise healthy\northodontic development so bone\nstructure low body fat levels and\nhealthy otherwise outward indicators\nsuch as having a strong hairline and\nclear skin and if you want to make the\nface more masculine then something like\na beard can also be used to change the\nshape of the jawline so that it meets\nwhat's considered the attractive angles\nand proportions for that particular\nracial group and this we can find out\nusing what's known as cephalometric\nanalysis if that sounds sounds\ninteresting to you and you'd like to get\nyour face analyzed in the way that we\nbroke it down here with a very\nmethodical researched approach much like\nan orthodontist or a clinician would\nwhich is what our team is made up of\nthen you can order a full face analysis\nover at the Coo's website or a detailed\nbreakdown of how you can improve your\nfacial appearance through a logical\nprocedure\nforeign"}]}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "okay quickly what do these celebrities\nhave in common Bella Hadid Olivia culpa\nLeah Michelle Emily radakowski Isaac\nGonzalez Zoe Kravitz Dove Cameron Sophie\nTurner well they're all celebrities that\nhave or are rumored to have had a buckle\nfat removal in today's video we're going\nto be discussing the increasingly\npopular cosmetic procedure known as\nbuckle fat removal and while this\nprocedure has been around for over 50\nyears the number of buccal fat\nprocedures has actually seen a\nsignificant increase in these past two\nyears with a reported 50 increase in\nthat time period according to recent\nstatistics from the American Society of\nplastic surgeon it's become especially\npopular among those who want to achieve\na more model-esque look but is this\nreally the right way to go about it in\nthis video I'm going to explain why it's\ncompletely not because you see Buckle\nfat removal also known as cheek\nreduction surgery is a procedure that\ninvolves removing excess fat from the\ncheeks to create a Slimmer and more\ndefined facial Contour many people seek\nout buccal fat removal in order to\nachieve a more defined and chiseled\nvegetable appearance and that procedure\ncan offer a number of benefits for those\nlooking to enhance their facial Contour\nbecause Hollow cheeks are a sign of\nfacial robusticity they basically\nemulate the face of somebody who has\nmore developed bone structure which is\nobviously an attractive facial feature\nbut getting buccal fat removal as a\ncosmetic procedure is in itself\nill-advised and that's for a number of\nreasons so in this video we're going to\ncover the hollow cheek Trend and why so\nmany celebrities are getting the removal\nprocedures but end up looking more gone\nand almost skeleton-like as they get\nolder so we see them everywhere you know\nthis hollow cheek model-esque look and\nit's invaded Hollywood with many\ncelebrities getting their procedure done\nto achieve or to meet the status quo of\nwhat it means to have a sharp defined\nface and mind you that having a sharp\ndefined face is actually a very\nwestern-centric Beauty standard in the\nEast having strong bone structure is\nstill important but they're prominent\nthe features are less well defined\nbecause a softer more rounded face is\nactually the prefer good but to best\nunderstand what Buckle fat pads are we\nneed to actually go into the science of\nit Buckle fat pads are a type of adipose\ntissue which is essentially fat that's\nlocated in the cheek area of the face\nand they're composed of cells called\nadipocytes which store energy in the\nform of or you guessed it fat the\nbiggest challenge to buckle fat pad\nremoval surgery and why a lot of\nSurgeons have stopped doing it is\nbecause this particular region is\nsurrounded completely by very sensitive\nfacial veins but for the interesting\nthing with Buckle fat pads is that they\ndon't seem to shrink or reduce with fat\nloss if you're already at a healthy or\nlow body fat what if you're already at a\nhealthy weight and you still have\nchipmunk cheeks for that we need to talk\nabout the bishop ball the bishop Bull\nand buckle fat pads are both collections\nof fatty tissues located in the cheeks\nand are often used quite interchangeably\nhowever there is a slight difference in\nthe exact location and function of these\nstructures the bishop bull are a smaller\nand more specific part of the buckle fat\npads and are mainly involved in the\ncontouring of the OG curve which is a\nimaginary line if you were to look at\nthe face from the three-quarter angle\nyou'd see the hollowness of the cheeks\nand although each face has its own\nspecific characteristics and each person\nwill has a unique face the bishop balls\nalso known as the bishop fat pads are\noften the cause of the chubby cheek look\nin individuals who have an otherwise\nnormal weight or body fat level they are\npresent at birth and typically don't\nvary much throughout a person's life\nregardless of weight loss or gain\nthey're composed mainly again of fat\ntissue which is known to be more\nresistant to change in volume than other\ntypes of tissues so it is quite hard to\nlose the chipmunk cheeks and that's why\nwe get the Buckle fat surgery the study\nby Dr James Dusen and colleagues\ndissected 12 fresh male cadavers and\ndecided to study their buccal fat and\nthey found that even bodies with low\noverall body fat levels had buccal fat\npads of the same size as bodies with a\nnormal body fat level\nand so that makes us understand that\nBuckle fat pads and the bishop balls\ndon't really change much with someone's\nbody fat and that a chubby cheeked look\ncreated by those fat pads can't really\nbe fixed through weight loss and so the\nideal candidates for getting a buckle\nfat pad removal surgery is typically\nsomebody with strong cheekbones that are\npoorly accentuated or they're not very\nvisible because of a fullness that's\npresent within the cheeks giving you\nthat chipmunk look and these patients\nlack tapering of their facial Contours\nbetween the Mala eminences or the\ncheekbones and the mandibular body or\nthe jawline and the removal of the\nbuccal fat produces a more angular\nappearance to the face reducing the\nfullness of the cheeks serves to\nhighlight the cheekbones and makes the\ncheekbones appear more prominent but in\nDr Susan's study the team emphasizes\nthat buccal fat removal is not suitable\nfor malar augmentation which is making\nthe cheekbones look bigger and larger\nand is not recommended in patients with\nMala hypoplasia which is an on the\ndevelopment of the cheekbones all\npatients that lack fullness in their\ncheeks buccal fat removal will only\naccentuate a gaunt appearance in these\npatients producing too much hollowing of\nthe cheeks and that's what we're seeing\nwith these celebrities as they get older\nthe buccal fat removal procedure or the\nreduction of the bishop balls called a\nbishop Tommy\nthat is a tough word I you try saying\nthat seems to be the perfect option for\npeople with naturally chubby cheeks that\nstill can't get a defined cheek look\ndespite losing you know body weight and\nall that fat so the answer to this\nquestion is more complex and there are\nnuances and considerations we need to\ntake into account because every\nindividual is different and has a\ndifferent facial structure what I'm\nsaying in simple speak is that you will\nnot all age in the same way some of you\nwill have more hollower cheeks in the\nfuture than you do now and others may\nnever get Hollow chicks just by the\nprocess of Aging many people are\ninspired by celebrities and a trend has\nemerged where people who previously have\nchubby cheeks are undergoing the removal\nprocedure to achieve that look however\nthis trend raises a lot of concerns\nabout the procedure itself and there's a\nreason why a lot of Surgeons are against\nit one primary concern is that the\nnatural loss of the buccal fat that\nappears with age is going to accentuate\nthe gauntness if you do get the surgery\nearly on in fact Martin Benjamin and\ncolleagues in their paper Buckle fat pad\nexcision proceed with caution showed\nthat the buccal fat pads vary as we age\nits size drastically increases between\nthe age of 10 to 20 which is you know\nthe baby fat period and then decreases\nover the following 30 years of life so\nyou will for most of you naturally lose\nit and get more of a go on face you can\njust look at your parents to see how you\nmight age but another paper from rorich\nand colleagues in their study the role\nof the buccal fat pad in facial\nAesthetic Surgery raise the concern of\nthis new explosion in buccal fat pad\nremoval procedures basically saying that\nthe long-term implications and the\naesthetic results of the procedures are\nstill not exactly understood and how\nmuch of the buccal fat pad persists or\ndiminishes as we age is still an area of\ndebate because it is different for a lot\nof people however the possibility of\ncausing premature aging and mid facial\nDistortion in the long run is a lot more\nclear and so with all that information I\nthink we can come to a reasonable\nconclusion anyone unhappy with the\ndefinition of their cheeks or are\nlooking to get a buccal fat pad removal\nprocedure should take into account three\nimportant points one is their own age as\nthe fat pads tend to shrink with age and\nare more present in the first 20 years\nof life team Smart in a young individual\nto wait and see how their cheeks evolve\nwith age to later discover that probably\nno procedure was realistically needed\nfor that person to be satisfied with the\nlook of their cheeks generally this is\naround the 20 to 30 period where as you\nenter your 30s you do tend to look\nsharper better presuming that you take\ncare of yourself in your 20s because\nreally the 20s are now in the 30s a\nsecond important point is to understand\nthe way someone's Buckle fat pad and\nBishop balls vary with age depending on\nthe individual all the genetics plays a\nrole in each individual's fat pads will\nevolve differently with age raises the\nconcern of the possibility of causing\npremature aging and mid-face distortion\nin the long run as World rich and\ncolleagues have mentioned in their paper\nin fact volume loss associated with\naging is actually quite a common\naesthetic concern and that's actually\ncorrected with fillers and injectables\nlater on in life if you get really sharp\ncheeks in your 20s you might end up\nfilling it back in in your 40s also\nconsider that the face naturally starts\nto Sag with age facial fat is disposed\nin different cavities and tends to\nreposition or shift within compartments\nfrom the gravity of just being alive a\nstudy by Alan e and colleagues explained\nthat aging leads to changes in fat\nposition resulting in downward migration\nof the fat pad with age the Mala fat\npads so your cheek fat pads descends and\nit shows a aging midface with a loss of\nhomogeneity and a deepening of the\nnasolabial folds which means essentially\ntheir smile lines will naturally get\ndeeper and your cheeks will naturally\nget hollower Additionally the\ngravitational theory of facial aging and\nshould buy Allen e in their paper also\nexplains that gravity plays an important\nrole in aging and contributes to that\nthat sagging look it suddenly makes a\nchoice of having a fat pad removal\nprocedure not that complicated as not\nonly the buccal fat pad changes in size\nwith age it also changes in position\nremoving too much fat from the fat pads\nor removing fat at the wrong place might\ninitially give you a great look but it\nalso has negative consequences on\nsomeone's future appearance creating an\noverly hollowed look lacking in cheek\nvolume and this is what we're seeing\nwith celebrities now in fact modern\nBenjamin and colleagues in buccal fat\npad excision proceed with caution show\nthat these signs of characteristic aging\nsuch as the smile lines the shifting of\nthe cheek and the reduction of total\nfacial fat are drastically increased in\nby cheek hollowing between the ages of\n30 and 40 meaning that if you get this\nnow in your 20s you will look much older\nthan you really are when you reach your\n30s and 40s the last point to consider\nis your own facial structures some\npeople think that they have full cheeks\nor undefined cheekbones and then they\nconsider a fat pad removal surgery but\nit's important to note that facial fat\nis not always the cause of an undefined\nface the absence of prominent cheekbones\nor a strong bone structure could also be\na contributing factor removing more\nbuccal fat in these cases would only\nenhance the flattening of the cheeks and\nas we mentioned earlier Dr stewson\nemphasizes that buccal fat removal is\ncontraindicated in patients that already\nlack fullness in their cheeks for those\npatients adding volume using dermal\nfillers might actually be a better\noption in order to achieve a more\ndefined look and better facial\ncontouring we touched on this process in\nthis video here explaining the\ndifference between more prominent cheeks\nor a more Hollow appearance this is\ncalled pseudozygomatic projection where\nyou can make the peaks of the mountains\nlarger or you can make the valleys\ndeeper to get the same end result and so\ndespite many celebrities getting buccal\nfat removal procedures done you should\nconsider your own individual features\nand characteristics it's going to be\ninteresting to see how these celebrity\nfaces do evolve with time and I think\nwe're starting to see some of the early\nremnants of it but those interested in\nthe procedure and we do advise against\nit but there will always be some people\nwho do want it then there are a couple\nof things to consider firstly you're\ngoing to have a professional that\nunderstands facial Symmetry and has a\nconservative approach in fact in James\nSusan's paper the anatomy and clinical\napplications of the buccal fat pad\nAdvocate a conservative excision of the\nbuccal fat pad only a small amount of\nfat should be removed initially to\nprevent over resection often it's\nnecessary to remove only one to two\ngrams of fat to obtain the aesthetic\nresult desired and adjust your\nexpectations accordingly in very full\ncheeked individuals it may prove\nnecessary to remove up to four to five\ngrams of fat on each side the result of\nresection or cutting are Apparent at the\ntime of the operation harvesting should\nbe done incrementally and the change in\nthe facial Contour should be appreciated\nrather than just removing what comes\neasily as the flavor of the month an\naggressive initial resection will lead\nto a later hollowed out look which is\nactually quite difficult to correct they\nalso indicate that providing cheap\nContour is pretty symmetrical before\nyour surgery a near amount of equal fat\nshould be removed from both sides if\nasymmetry exists prior to surgery this\ncan usually be harvested slightly more\nfat from the Fuller site that's pretty\nstraightforward the procedure involves\nmaking an incision inside the cheek and\nthen removing some of the fatty tissue\nfrom the buccal fat pad which are\nlocated in the cheeks so it's worth\nnoting that these studies report average\nin this recovery time will probably\nchange from person to person and it's\nalso important to keep in mind that the\nfull healing after the surgery can take\nup to three to six months and that the\nfinal outcome of the procedure can be\nassessed more or less during this time\nso when it comes to the safety Lucas\nBoren Mora and his colleagues looked at\n71 patients in their paper and six of\nthem presented complications which is\naround eight percent such as prismus\nfacial asymmetry and hemorrhages so\nthere you have it buccal fat pads 101 if\nyou're interested in knowing more about\nyour own facial features because their\ncurves we specialize in helping people\nlook their best or you're curious to see\nhow certain cosmetic or non-cosmetic\nchanges would look on your face you can\naccess a free

of\npeople wearing them for aesthetic\nreasons as vandalad and colleagues\ndiscuss the use of facial accessories\nsuch as your piercings and your glasses\nhave a huge impact in the way people are\nperceived by others in fact we make\nincredibly fast judgments about one's\nappearance within just a tenth of a\nsecond of seeing their face and in that\ntime we form an opinion that is very\ndifficult to change afterwards this one\nshown by Willis and colleagues in their\npaper First Impressions making up your\nmind after 300 millisecond exposure to a\nface so have you wondered if wearing\nglasses actually makes you more\nattractive in this 100 millisecond\nperiod and does it help you look better\nin the eyes of other people if so does\nit affect the probabilities of getting\nan interview for a new job for example\nwhether or not glasses make you more\nattractive is actually a very\ncomplicated question but the answer\ndepends on many indicative factors such\nas age gender ethnicity and education\nlevel or more specifically just the type\nof glasses used can change the way\nyou're perceived so let's take a look at\nwhat the scientists who have been trying\nto answer this question many years have\nto say about it there is a stereotype\nthat wearing glasses makes individuals\nlook less attractive but it does enhance\ntheir other traits such as intelligence\nand from other studies we know that\nintelligence is an attractive trait so\nwhich one is it the idea has some\nscientific Merit to it as stated in the\npaper by shul the influences of glasses\nin the perception of professionals from\ndifferent cultural backgrounds however\nscientific results regarding the effect\nof glasses on attractiveness are not\nconsistent in other research we see that\nmaking a spectacle of yourself the\neffect of glasses and sunglasses on\nfacial perceptions by Graham and\ncolleagues shows that individuals\nwearing glasses are not considered less\nattractive at all in addition it seems\nthat gender stereotypes have an\ninfluence on the perception of the\nappearance of a person who wears glasses\nhowever the conclusions of these studies\nare also very inconsistent for example\nBorgen study reports a finding that\nwomen without glasses were showed as\nmore attractive than men without glasses\nand on the contrary another study shows\nthat men rated women who wear glasses as\nmore attractive than men who don't and\nso these discrepancies may be due to the\nfact that attractiveness is a broadly\ndefined concept which needs to be\ndefined in very specific ways for your\nparticular research study in his\nresearch okamura mentions dimensions of\nphysical attractiveness which is an\nimportant concept as Beauty and\nyouthfulness are not exactly the same\nthing as defining attractiveness by say\ndimorphism or symmetry it's possible\nthat the usage of glasses does affect\nsome dimensions of beauty or physical\nattractiveness but not all of them it\nmay make you look less youthful but it\nmay also increase your facial symmetry\nfor example by hiding the asymmetries of\nyour eyes one of the dimensions of\nattractiveness is related to age he and\ncolleagues studied the impact of aging\non facial attractiveness using empirical\nand computational methods they confirm\nthe hypothesis that in general younger\nfaces are considered more attractive but\ndoes wearing glasses affect the\ndimension of youthfulness in a recent\nstudy published in the Journal of eye\nperception by Bruna and colleagues aim\nto address the question they randomly\nselected photographs of 25 male and\nfemale faces from a public database and\nused a digital aging filter to stimulate\ntwo different competition older and\nyounger in addition they also digitally\nadded generic eyeglasses and sunglasses\nto the face and afterwards 21 Men and 21\nwomen were asked to report the estimated\nage of both the young and old faces\ndisplayed on the monitor with or without\nthe glasses the young Pacers were\nperceived as 1.3 years older when the\nglasses were added while adding glasses\nto the old faces did not alter their\nperceived age in other words the older\nfaces didn't look younger because they\nhad glasses added as for the sunglasses\nthey also didn't change the perceived\nage of the younger faces but it did\nreduce the perceived age of the older\nFaces by 1.8 years although the\ndifferences in perceived ages are small\nthese results suggest that wearing\nglasses may have a Sly effect on one of\nthe dimensions of attractiveness which\nis namely youthfulness in fact the\nfinding that sunglasses make older\npeople look younger maybe due to the\nfact that dark glasses help to conceal\nwrinkles around the eyes which are often\nassociated with aging it is important to\ninterpret results from this type of\nstudy with a lot of caution as they\nalways have a very limited scope many\nvariables such as the ethnicity of the\neyeglass wearer or the Observer the\nstars of the glass is used and the\ninfluence of facial expression were not\ncontrolled for so take that with a grain\nof salt as we already mentioned The\nStereotype holds that wearing glasses\nreduces perceived attractiveness but\nincreases the perception of other traits\nlike intelligence in the job World The\ncredibility of a candidate is likely to\nbe influenced by subtle visual cues in\nthe profile picture for example these\nvisual cues can affect an employer's\ndecision to hire them or not as\ndiscussed by carers and colleagues in a\npaper called LinkedIn and Facebook in\nBelgium the influences and biases of\nsocial network sites in Recruitment and\nselection procedures so does wearing\nglasses have an impact on the likelihood\nof getting a job in such a study that's\nexactly what Van Der land and colleagues\naddressed in their work are spectacles\nthe female equivalent of beards for men\nour spectacles in a LinkedIn profile\ninfluences the likelihood of getting the\njob in this study the authors analyzed\nthe perceived credit ability of a\ncandidate with and without glasses and\ncredibility is a broad concept which\ngenerally includes things like expertise\ntrustworthiness and of course\nattractiveness so their case study was a\njob as a promotion model at a\npromotional agency this position was\nassumed to require attractiveness as a\ncharacteristic trait of the applicant\nbecause well it's a promotional job at a\npromotional agency surprisingly the\nauthors found that the female candidates\nin the study were perceived as more\ncredible for this job with the glasses\nthan without them which is interesting\nbecause the idea is that glasses are\nsupposedly going to make you less\nattractive so then why were they seen as\nmore credible for this job this result\ngoes against the author's expectations\nas it opposes that type of stereotype\nthat glasses are making you less\nattractive the possible explanation that\nthey provided is that the type of\nglasses used in the study you know with\na thick Rim induced symmetry in the face\nwhich is considered by many researchers\nas an attribute of attractiveness the\nauthors conclude their analysis\nindicates that job applicants should be\ncareful when choosing whether or not to\nwear glasses in their profile pictures\nand to also take into account the type\nof job that they're intending to apply\nfor and the type of glasses that they\nchoose to represent their character\nwhile some adults choose to wear glasses\neven for aesthetic reasons even when\nthey don't really need them there is a\nsituation in life where kneading glasses\nis a game changer namely in childhood in\nschools negative stereotypical words are\noften used to describe children who wear\nglasses in their paper use of eyeglasses\namong children in elementary school the\nperceptions and behaviors coach bacheva\nand colleagues analyze the issues\nassociated with wearing glasses at\nschool in the interviews with parents\nand school workers they found that\neyewear is viewed as unattractive in\nthese environments and that there is a\nsocial stigma associated with its use\nmany of the parents had negative\nattitudes and feelings towards wearing\nthe glasses due to their own negative\nexperiences as children they removed\nglasses being considered unattractive\nwhen they were younger as well and so\nthese attitudes carry on to adulthood\nsome African-American parents stated\nthat having Vision impair Germans as a\nchild may have been associated with the\nmental health issues such as lower\nself-esteem as a result of This research\nthe authors recommended interventions to\npromote the use of glasses in society as\nan attractive Trend such as initiating\ncampaigns with public figures wearing\nglasses to gain visibility and rendered\nthem as attractive and fashionable\nbasically changing the perception of\nglasses in the public eye so it's\nimportant to note that we're looking at\nglasses as a concept from two different\nangles one is that the research says\nthat classes in some way do have an\neffect on youthfulness and they may also\nimprove symmetry in the face so from\nthat biological way classes are a\npositive but socially we have this idea\nthat glasses are a negative because\nthey're nerdier they're associated with\nnerdy things and for whatever reasons\nthose may be seen as bad things so\ndespite the social and biological\ndifferences if we can make glasses more\nacceptable socially then it's pretty\neasy to say that glasses do make you\nmore attractive several of the videos on\nour Channel explore the perceptions of\ndifferent facial traits it's interesting\nto think whether perceptions remain\nconstant over time according to Graham\nand colleagues which we mentioned\nearlier glasses wearing has become more\nfashionable in recent years and so\nthere's no longer that stigma that's\nbeen attached previously in the past\nthere does seem to be a shift trending\nwith glasses in modern society becoming\nmore socially acceptable these novel\nTrends may have a positive impact in\ncertain environments such as schools but\nit doesn't really affect most of us\ngrown adults who aren't in school so to\nanswer the main question do glasses make\nyou more attractive well there's no easy\nanswer like we showed it from two\ndifferent angles it depends we\ndiscovered that the impact of the use of\nglasses on people's attractiveness is\ninfluenced by many factors it depends\nagain on gender with women appearing to\nbe more affected than men it depends on\nage as we've seen it affects directly\nwhether you are a kid or an adult as to\nthe youthfulness benefit that you get\nfrom the glasses it also depends on\nwhich attribute of attractiveness is\nconsidered for examples glasses may\naffect the perception of age but not\nsexiness also trans and social\nperceptions seem to change over time\nnonetheless wearing glasses can have\nsignificant implications at any stage of\nlife whether it be as a child in school\nor as an adult searching for a job it\nreally doesn't matter now if you'd like\nto learn a bit more about your face\nshape and what type of glasses would\nbenefit you or if they don't benefit you\nat all and you should go with contacts\nwell we have a standardized method of\nanalyzing that over at the curve's\nwebsite through our comprehensive\nanalysis and our

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Video Title: Do Attractive People Have Better Personalities? | Beauty Psychology"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The ultimate greatest irony in the whole debate is that the looks vs personality is a false dichotomy.\nGood looking people usually do have the best personalities because how can you demand someone who\nis ugly and has been rejected every time and thus become isolated for years to have a personality\nat all that alone to have a good enough one that will make up for their looks. Life is just a\nresult of our lived experiences and the more positive feedback we receive, which is mostly\naffected by looks the more we reinforce positive behaviour. It is often thought that attractive\npeople must have repulsive personalities because they've never had to work on improving themselves\nin any other way. The virtue of being born aesthetically gifted is not enough to go through life with\nthe personality of a doorknob but this is actually a comforting lie because the very statement that\nattractive people do not have personalities is not falsifiable meaning it cannot be proven wrong\nand so we take comfort in believing that attractive people go through life without trying to\nbetter themselves in the same way that everyone else does. They watch Koo's charisma on command\nDaniel Simmons and channels just like that just like you do because they want to become even better.\nIn reality, attractive people do develop the most likable personalities because everything else in\nlife is biased in their favour. A number of psychology effects from the halo effect to\ndeserving exterior and sociometer theory grant unfair benefits that allow them to experience\nmore freely throughout life which are direct requirements to building a personality which is why\nit is arguably better to invest in your physical looks first rather than your personality\nbecause of the psychological phenomena that were covered in this video. But to understand the\nproblem we need to define personality. Personality theory and research by Sauravon in\nPervin 2022 defines attractive personality as charisma. If I say that Kevin Hart has a lot of\npersonality that's not the same usage of the word as saying oh my professor has zero personality.\nPersonality in this sense refers to charisma being able to say the right things at the right time\nmake people feel the right emotions is what charisma is and that refers back to attraction.\nWhat the average person considers a likable personality is actually based on a few theories.\nThe nominological, trait theory, behaviorism and personal construct theory all of which revolve\naround one's human interpretation of the world. In simple speak how you are treated by the world\nshapes how you see it. And so how you react to it forms your personality. Negative experiences\nlead to negative broken people. Positive experiences lead to healthy positive people. You see\nphysical looks are a form of social capital. A likable personality is also a form of social\ncapital. Social capital are a form of let's say an invisible wealth that you or I have to convince\npeople around us to do things instead of paying someone with real money to do something for me.\nThey do it because they like me. Whether it be to marry and live happily ever after or\ncalm someone out of their life savings. Marina Toulin and her colleagues in the 2018 paper use\nthis concept of social capital to explain that personality shapes the individual's ability to\ncreate social capital. A likable person will be invited to more events, get more opportunities,\nrise up to social ladder faster than an un likable person. An attractive person makes the friend group\nlook good. Again, getting more opportunities, building more experiences. These are all benefits of\nyour social capital. In fact, in their thesis, they link openness, extraversion, emotional stability\nand agreeableness as being the key factors for generating social capital. And as a reminder,\nwe want more social capital to live better lives. But if you're unattractive and badly socialized\nand this is what that comment at the beginning was talking about, put it into more scientific terms\nyou lack the social capital to convince others to help you live a quality life. If Toulin's paper\nsuggests that being outgoing, friendly, socially adjusted, emotionally stable are necessary\nfor building social capital. Even without any studies, at this point, I think you and I\ncan probably already guess that being unattractive will put you at a huge disadvantage to have the\nskills needed to make social capital. One reason for this is that physical looks and personality\nare not separate entities, but are actually very closely intertwined. McGloin and Denese\n2016 found that men perceive attractive women as less trustworthy and women perceive attractive\nmen as more trustworthy. The concept of what is an attractive personality trait in this sense is\nactually very arbitrary, it's not fixed. It changes based on external factors. Similarly,\nphysical looks can also be arbitrary to a limit. That's why we say that beauty is both subjective\nand objective. As a handsome guy can quickly become a very repulsive one if he has a ugly\npersonality, he says some very silly things. This implies that you cannot have one without the other,\nlooks and personality, or going back to McGloin's study, less attractive men are perceived as less\ntrustworthy by women and less attractive women are perceived as more trustworthy by men. The scale of\npersonality goes up and down with looks and by sex demographics. Another argument for this is\nthe well-known halo effect. First observed by psychologists Edward Dorndyke in 1920,\nthis is a bias that we have for attractive people, where we assume that by being attractive,\nthey must be good in all other aspects of their life as well, such as being more likeable having\na better personality. We see this bias form in children as young as three years old, and again\ngoing back to the idea that personality and looks are interlinked with each other, the opposite of\nthe halo effect is called the devil effect. Basically, we're unattractive people are assumed\nautomatically to have unlikable personalities and to be anti-social people. If you want to learn\nmore about this, there's something called the double devil effect. Listen to episode 7 of the\nDeep Dive podcast on Spotify. Norman and colleagues 2009 also confirmed that physical appearances are\ndirectly tied to how people perceive or they see your personality. The researchers found\nquite accurate links between emotional stability and physical looks, and if you remember going back,\nemotional stability is one of those factors with generating social capital, the way you present\nyourself from being tensed or relaxed, always smiling or grim and serious, having a sickly,\nblemished appearance, acne scars, versus having glass smooth skin, tell the world a lot of non-verbal\ncues about your personality and more often than not, it's actually very accurate. Lastly,\nHoltzmann and Strube 2013 find that people with negative personality traits tend to either be\nmore physically attractive or create an attractive persona to lure their victims. From dressing\nbetter being squeaky clean, being deceptively likable, ironically the most successful serial killers\nin the past had to look deliberately and behave nothing like a serial killer. The idea that beauty\nequals a lack of personality is a foolish idea because personality can be fact more easily than\nphysical looks can. An example of this behavior was American serial killer Ted Bundy who no doubt\nwas a handsome man and used his looks to develop a charming personality, not the other way around.\nAnd we know this from empirical evidence and this charm is what he would use to attract female\nvictims. Had Ted Bundy looked a certain way, then he probably wouldn't have gotten the ability\nto build his charm and charisma. Ugly intentions were hidden behind a handsome appearance,\njust like the recent paper proposed. And the scary thing is, all of these examples his victims\nwould have considered him to have a likable personality and the victims are a proxy for the rest\nof society because he did have a likable personality. The monster within was never shown only until\nthe very end. What was shown was his physical looks. So perhaps if you haven't called on to the\ntitle of this video, attractive people have the best personalities. It's because even when they're\nwrong, they're right. As a whole, as a society we perceive the actions of the attractive to be\nmuch minor transgressions than those of the more unattractive groups. To say that attractive people\nhave bad personalities is only a half truth because even if they do have a bad personality,\nsociety will perceive it as good. And in this video, there were multiple examples of that. For\nexample, Holzmann et al. 2010 and Fowler et al. 2009 have both shown that reckless, arrogant,\nand psychopathic behavior is attractive during first impressions. Also, if they are attractive,\nbut the opposite if they are unattractive. I think cognitive illusion 2022, one of my favorite\nbooks, summarizes this best on page 264. In general, good looking people are less likely to be held\nresponsible for their transgressions than unattractive people. In fact, mistakes committed by attractive\nchildren are taken as mistakes, but unattractive children are thought to be making the mistakes\npurposefully or that they'll do it again and they're punished more heavily. If personalities are\nformed from the experiences and children as young as three are both aware of beauty and ugly\nand are treated differently for it by adults, then there is no justifiable reason for why attractive\npeople wouldn't on the whole develop better personalities having been given every advantage\navailable for every funny guy. There's a handsome but also funny version for every bubbly\nsocialite. There's a prettier version who had the gift of personality handed to them by virtue\nof being attractive, not necessarily the other way around."}]}

to say\nI feel like these girls are actually\nvery insecure I feel like they're a\nreason that they're attracted to guys\nlike this is because they feel more\nsecure within themselves if they're with\nsomeone that they think is beneath them\nthey think this person will see the\nvolume in them and be so obsessed with\nthem I wouldn't think to like cheat or\nyou know disrespect them in any way but\nthe crazy thing is they end up getting\ndisrespected and cheated on anyways and\nthen let's say you have a messy breakup\nand then they get salty afterwards then\ntheir comeback is gonna be like okay\nyeah he was a loser anyways he wasn't\nattendant he wasn't on my level but I\nfeel like the deeper question you should\nbe asking yourself is why are you going\nfor people like that instead of going\nfor people on your level and walking\naway when you see the first time in\ndisrespect yeah I completely agree with\nthat and perhaps you've seen it for\nyourself often times and very attractive\nman or woman will date down in terms of\nphysical looks and purely unfaith's\nphysical looks and the scientific\nliterature calls this a mismatched\ncouple now people can date down\nintelligence or maybe in wealth there's\nso many factors you can either date up\nor down in because again not everyone is\nequal that it doesn't work like that\nphysical looks is the most studied\nfeature in the scientific literature\nbecause it's the most visible one and\noutside side observers so me and you\nwalking on the street when we see a\ncouple like this we often have very\nmixed feelings about it and that's what\nscience wants to find out why do we feel\nthis way reading through the comments it\nseems that the tick tock commenters also\nhave mixed feelings about this some say\nthat it's a defense mechanism like this\nwoman here who if you can't read it says\nwhen he thinks he's a 10 because he\npulled you but you like ugly men which\nis pretty funny to me but um yeah so\nsome say defense mechanisms 100 right\ndefinitely a girl uh they are super\ninsecure you only attract where you are\nI want my partner to be well like\nattractive and have friends outside of\nme I agree that's that's me as well but\nlet's try to understand why this idea\nexists so this is one of the older\nresearch papers on what's known as\nEquity Theory so Equity Theory is\nbasically saying that we make up for a\ndeficiency in physical looks in a\nmismatched couple so again differences\npurely on physical looks by compensating\nit for it with something else maybe that\nother member who is not as attractive is\nvery intelligent very wealthy there's so\nmany other things that we can't see\nother than physical looks so going\nthrough it the Equity Theory of\nintersexual attraction offers a\ntentative explanation for discrepancies\nagain in mismatched couples according to\nEquity Theory important attributes\nbesides pleasing physical\ncharacteristics example intelligence\nplay a role in heterosexual interaction\nif an unattractive person possesses a\nlarge number of non-physical qualities\nhe might be deemed highly desirable and\nable to attract a physically appealing\nmate similarly a physically attractive\nindividual who has nothing else to offer\nwill not be considered desirable and be\nforced to settle for someone who is less\nattractive and so it's just funny to me\num and both amrada and that girl in The\nTick Tock are admitting to the audience\nin a very round about way that they\ndon't have much to offer other than\ntheir physical looks because according\nto Equity Theory again it's a theory\nthat somebody who is physically\nattractive but dates down must not have\nwhole lot to offer and therefore must\nnot be seen as a desirable mate to\nsomebody who is on their equal league in\nphysical attractiveness but also has\nother desirable non-physical qualities\nas the lady in the original Tick Tock\nvideo was telling us one of the reasons\nthat she hypothesizes is because people\ndo this to secure themselves a partner\nwho won't cheat on them so ultimately\nthis comes from a fear of insecurity the\nthe idea stems from insecurity and\nthat's one reason which I do agree with\nif you are insecure as a partner in a\nrelationship you're going to choose\nsomebody who you expect to not cheat on\nyou but the thing is cheetahs will cheat\nthe physical attractiveness discrepancy\ndifference in physical attractiveness\nhas nothing to do with whether they\ncheat or not and there's actual research\non this I'll see if I'll save that for\nanother video\nbut we did cover this on the podcast\nepisode in an episode called the fear of\ndying alone so I'll give you the rundown\nof what the summary of that podcast\nepisode was all the research basically\nwhen we tend to date down for one reason\nor another people with a high fear of\ndying alone generally more attractive\npeople tend to date down because they\nfeel that if they don't find a partner\nthey will die alone and in that sense\nthey have to justify to themselves why\nthey have dated down in physical\nattractiveness by having some form of\ncognitive dissonance now cognitive\ndissonance is basically having two ideas\ntwo contrasting ideas in your head and\ntrying to basically lie to yourself some\npeople say it's a cope you may have\nheard cope code in the comments that's\ncognitive dissonance where you're lying\nto yourself to justify an otherwise\nuncomfortable truth so when somebody\ndates down because they have a high fear\nof dying alone then they're undergoing\nsome form of cognitive dissonance to\njustify to themselves that I'm dating\ndown not because I care about looks but\nbecause this person is is very\nintelligent they're very smart they're\nwealthy they're this they're that\nthey're very loving caring so all of a\nsudden then we start to look for\nnon-physical characteristics but the\nvery biology of human nature is that\nwe've always cared about physical\ncharacteristics first so only when\nthat's not an option funnily enough we\nstart we tend to care about other things\nand I'll show you the research on that\nin this video as well because they're\nboth of those ideas the fear of dying\nalone and Equity Theory tie into the\nsame framework basically so in this\nparticular paper and I know it's an\nolder paper but again I just want to go\nto where this idea first came about\nprevious investigations have not\ngathered the data necessary to support\nor refute this hypothesis so again it's\njust a theory at this stage at least in\nthe 1970s War State until 1978 noted\nthat persons who reported themselves to\nbe the more attractive member of a\ncouple indicated that their Partners had\ncompensating qualities this right here\nis an example of the cognitive\ndissonance that I was just talking about\nyou you say that you are the most more\nattractive couple and when somebody asks\nwhy are you dating this person you say\noh it's because they have this this and\nthis or I don't care about physical\nlooks I'm not a shallow person but the\nreality is we all care about physical\nlooks we all do because it is in our\nbiological imperative it is in our best\ninterest to care about physical looks so\nthat we can choose the best chances for\nour future Offspring regardless\nunfortunately birthstride and WildStar\nhave observed that there is no no worthy\ncorrelation between self-related\nattractiveness and actual attractiveness\npeople are not much more accurate at\nevaluating their Partners although it\ncan be concluded that persons who feel\nthat they are more attractive than their\nconsort or their Partners believe their\npartners are superior in other areas and\nwhether this belief is accurate remains\nto be confirmed so that's the most\nimportant part of this basically we\nthink that they're more better in\nsomething else other than looks far\neasier to measure you can tell when two\nmembers of a couple are mismatched\nwhereas with intelligence with wealth\nthose other aspects you can't really\ntell from gland so in that sense it's a\nbit more objective we tend to say oh no\nthey're more intelligent than they\nreally are oh no they are more loving\nand caring and basically these\nnon-tangible things you can't really\nhold or touch or measure\num to justify why we're with those\nPartners this is from burshard's other\npaper and I want to touch on this as\nwell so he basically explains this with\nthe matching hypothesis now give you the\nrundown very quickly of the matching\nhypothesis we tend to choose the\npartners that we think we have the best\nChances with that's that's\nstraightforward so we want to maximize\nour\nattractiveness partner the part the\nattractiveness of our partner and we\nwant to minimize the rejection rate just\nlike optimizing like in a in a code or\nin a game or something like that we want\nto optimize our hit rate with our um\nfailure rate that makes sense but when\nwe date down we we it's like giving up\nthe attractiveness\num part of that equation in favor of\nmaximizing our success rate so when that\nlady at the beginning the second lady\nwho was stitching the video was\nexplaining that people who do this\npeople who date down and you know they\nquote unquote into ugly men which I\nthink is is a very condescending way of\nputting it they're doing so to maximize\nthe hit rate\num the success rate lowered the\nrejection rate but in reality the theory\num this idea this framework doesn't\nactually work out because again men who\nmen who want to achieve will cheat\nregardless uh women who want to cheat\nwill also cheat regardless here's\nsomething interesting interestingly\nwhile physical attractiveness appears to\nbe the biggest correlated and predictor\nit rarely appears as the most important\nwhen directly asked of subjects\nattributes like personality and\ncharacter usually rank higher either\nthese people are not aware of how\nimportant physical attractiveness is in\nthe selection criteria or they are not\nfully honest I've said this many times I\neven there's another podcast episode on\nthis where we use a couple of research\nstudies on what what's it called field\ndating dating experiments you know like\nspeed dating experiments and basically\nevery time physically attractiveness\nbeing physically attractive was the\nhighest determinant of whether you would\nget a successful day outcome or not more\nrecent papers on the topic perceptions\nof a mismatch coupled 2022 basically\nfound that when the woman is\nsignificantly more attractive than the\nman other men see it as an opportunity\nto do what's known as mate coaching\nbasically come into the relationship and\ntake the woman away because you know her\nman is not doing it for her in whatever\nway especially physically then it's\nyou're competing against other men now\nto me that seems like a hellish scenario\nif especially as a man uh because not\nonly do I feel more insecure in this\nrelationship if the if my partner is\nsignificantly more attractive than me\nbut also now I have to compete against\nother men at a much greater rate uh\nconversely what the research paper found\nis that when the woman is less\nattractive than the man then men desire\nto make copy which means that they will\nbasically do the same thing so they will\nalso find a woman who is less attractive\nthan them and in that sense they're\nhappier because\nI I can only assume that they think that\nshe's not going to leave because\num again there's that mismatch so to me\nyou can look at it from two directions\none if a woman who is significantly more\nattractive than you is willing to date\nyou as a less attractive man a glass\nhalf full a positive approach might be\nthat she sees things in you other than\nyour physical looks like maybe she\nthinks you're very intelligent or you\nhave good fatherly characteristics for\nthe long run that's that's a good thing\nbut on the glass half empty the negative\nperspective it makes you question what\nis it that she gets out of this\nrelationship because again under Equity\nTheory she must have I mean that's what\nthe theory says she must have nothing to\noffer other than her physical looks and\njust personally thinking about it it\nwould seem like a pretty hellish\nscenario because you're always going to\nbe competing with other men at a much\ngreater rate at a much more increased\nradio there's always going to be guys\ncoming left and right saying oh I can do\nbetter than your man I'm better than\nyour man for whatever reason it just\nseems like a power Dynamic it just seems\nlike an unfair power Dynamic and I don't\nthink it's very healthy for a\nrelationship just in general for one\npartner to feel like they're better than\nthe other\n[Music]"}]}

versus one by jubilee to\nexplain the differences between how\npeople look as teenagers to how they\nlook as young adolescents and how most\npeople will look like that naturally\neven if they don't put in any effort and\nwe confuse that as a glow up which is\nsomething that takes a lot of extraneous\neffort to change the course of what you\nwould have otherwise look like so\nchanging the course of a grow up by\nputting an effort to make it a glow up\nactual significant changes come rather\nfrom 20 to maybe your 40s and that's\nwhen the efforts of your aesthetic\nroutines like taking care of yourself\nhaving a hair loss routine wearing\nsunscreen those things really separate\nthose who put in the effort from those\nwho do not but\ngoing from puberty to say your 20s most\npeople will look better undeniably from\nwhen they were a teen\nas long as they're you know within\nwithin reasonable expectation so like i\nsaid we're not going to really focus too\nmuch on the interactions between the\nparticipants we're just going to focus\non the photos\nso let's go through that my acne trying\nto get it better and then this this\none's funny too this one and the the end\nof my favorite because this one's just\nlike a double chin and like super low\nand awkward and funny\ndo i have to give a reason for\neliminating them i'd like to hear a\nreason oh\nso mean i just i feel really bad\ni'm gonna go with contestant\nthree\ni don't really know my reason i just\nthink number three first\nhi nice to meet you i'm so sorry i feel\nso bad nice to meet you what's your name\nmarshall nice to meet you nice to meet\nyou\nglow up for sure thank you i like your\noutfit too i mean\nagain she looks bone structure wise\nexactly the same she has filled in her\nbrows more and that's just makeup\nshe's not smiling in the other one but i\nwould also assume she has some dental\nwork done her lips are\ni don't i can't tell if she's had much\nwork to that but more or less exactly\nthe same\nthing i feel so bad don't feel bad you\nknow i kind of understand she's also\nobviously leaner that's that's a given\nmost people most young children get\nleaner as they get older as they lose\nthat baby fat heads are an acquired\ntaste so i figured i'd either be the\nfirst to go or the last to go who will\nbe our next illumination\nnumber seven\n[Music]\nhi hi nice to meet you so i felt like me\nand my mother almost my age are going to\nbe eliminated now yeah they're not\nthey're really not that bad well they\nare\nyou're just funny how old were you in\nthat i guess like 14 ish\nvery similar yet again\num\neye color is different i think that's\njust the lighting her brow seems to be a\nbit more filled in actually i don't\nthink she's had anything\nno kind of makeup to the brow\nmore or less exactly the same and that's\nkind of the point of making there is no\nsignificant change um going from puberty\nto adulthood it's just small little\nthings along the way there is no\nsignificant change for the large\nmajority of people\nyeah thank you\nokay so this is the third person to get\neliminated and this is very this is\nsomething i actually do want to talk\nabout so if you look at her first photo\nyou can see that\nthe\nthe corner of where her jaw changes it\nchanges its shape this is called the\njorgonian it's actually very high it\nalmost goes it starts above her upper\nlip\nit's indicative of a very narrow and\nlong jaw that goes downwards rather than\nforwards and for those reasons it\ncreates this exact shape of her face\nby virtue of not changing that and\nobviously i think she was well aware of\nthis because she has orthodontic braces\nand some other things going on in her\nchildhood photos i'm guessing her\nparents\nnoticed this as well\nby virtue of that still being the same\nher face is realistically the exact same\nas it was in her teenage years so\nnothing has changed if your social\nstanding was as the hot girl in your\nfriend group then you too will also be\nthe hot girl in your friend group as an\nadult\nbut that's not a glow up because you're\nstill in the same position it's even as\na hot kill to a hot girl that's still\njust a grow up but if you go from an\naverage looking girl to the hot girl in\nyour friend group now then your social\nstanding has changed based on your\nphysical looks and in that case that is\nthe definition of a glow up but to\nachieve such a glow up there needs to be\nsignificant changes to your facial\nstructure most importantly because that\nis the characteristic that is often\nhardest to change but also to other\ncharacteristics like skin hair like some\nof the other women have shown but the\npoint i'm making is that for most people\nthe significant differences between\nteenagehood and adulthood are just not\nthere they they're just an older version\nof their younger selves\nhi\nnice to meet you nice to meet you i'm\njanae marshall so real estate that's\ncool yeah that's what yeah i\nwas so hard i was like real estate you\nknow\nokay so janaya has\nagain\nprobably\ni guess very similar features i i just\nthink she lost the acne i genuinely\ncannot talk if you look at her nose\nshape it's the exact same nothing's\nchanged um her dental alignment is\nexactly the same bone structure is\nexactly the same she was she was already\nthe person she is now in her 20s back\nwhen she was like 14 15 and that's\nusually the case for most women they hit\npuberty earlier than men so there is\nless significant changes and i think\nthat's why men have much more\nsignificant glow ups um because the\ndifference between what they were before\nand now is so much more drastic\nagain\nexact same features other structures\nexactly the same in fact you can see she\nsmiles the exact same way too you can\nsee where the nasolabial lines are\nexact same direction exact same face\nit's it's a grow up she hasn't changed\nanything um significant about her face\nthis would have happened regardless just\nthe progression of growing up as an\nadult looking through the comments there\npretty much what i was expecting it's\njust people commenting on how\nthese examples are just grow ups people\ngrowing up in age rather than glow ups\nwhich is quite different right and here\nis abba and preacher's video on the same\nthing the same video\nabout preach are two black comedians\nthey have 1.7 million subscribers\nthey're very big there are some\ninteresting segments from abba and\npreacher's video i'm not saying that\nthere's not genuine glow-ups\nwith the women that's not what i'm\nsaying a lot of your glow-ups is makeup\nand that's not a real glow-up that's not\na glow-up that's a up\nmaybe the room's too bright can't see\nthe glow\nno no\nmaybe the room still i'm just saying i\ncould see a bit of cell phone like i\ndon't know\nyou were right\nwe need to decide no no no no no let's\nappreciate the definition of a globe\nyeah so if you thought i was being harsh\num there's plenty of content creators\nwho've reviewed this video and they they\nall say something more or less similar\nthat these women didn't particularly\nglow up and although you know in girly\npop culture we like to believe that\neveryone's beautiful and everyone's\nhaving their glow up yes queen\nit's just you know the fact of life is\nthat not everyone will have a glow up uh\nbecause glow-ups require very\nsignificant effort i'm sure they may\nhave put some kind of aesthetic labor\ntowards improving their looks everyone\ndoes that but that's not the same thing\nas a glow-up which requires sacrifice\nand a lot of effort\nand uh reading through the comments of\nthat video their their video uh preaches\nspot on about makeup does it change the\nlook completely it's very different from\nwhat they actually look like seeing\nsomeone without makeup compared to with\nmakeup can look two completely different\npeople sometimes it's crazy you wouldn't\neven recognize them and think it's a\ncompletely different person that's true\nthat's kind of what i was saying none of\nthose women actually had glow ups they\njust applied makeup because structurally\nnothing nothing's changed they've\nchanged their hair color but that's kind\nof superficial um\nthey got leaner which is gonna happen\nanyway so what i'm saying is these\nthings would have happened anyway uh\neveryone improves their looks as they\nget older just by virtue of being alive\nfor a bit longer being a bit wiser but a\nglow up an example maybe to illustrate\nthis is losing a significant amount of\nweight going from 300 pounds to maybe\n150 pounds\nyour life if you just let aging take\nover\nyou would have just kept gaining weight\nso there was significant intervention\nyou you sat down and you said something\nhas to change about my looks or maybe my\nhealth to make things be better\na grow up would be if i just let myself\nstay 300 pounds and just let you know\nfather time take over and i just kept\naging and somehow i looked better as a\n50 year old 300 pound man than when i\nwas a 20 year old 300 pound man which\nobviously doesn't work like that then\nthat would be a grow up so hopefully you\ncan appreciate it's all about the the\nchange of changing your course the\nchanging your destiny basically of what\nyou would look like your face whereas\nwith most grow ups it's just people just\nletting you know\ntime and nature take over and not really\nputting in much\neffort to change very significant things\nwhich obviously require sacrifice and a\nlot of effort\n[Music]"}]}

Any \nfurther and the face becomes uncanny. This  \nisn’t as unusual as you may think. Telecanthus or \nHyper-telorism is the medical term for increased  \ndistance between two points and is often common \nin patients suffering from cleft malformations  \nor congenital defects like fetal alcohol \nsyndrome. It is this link back to a physical  \nhealth anomaly that makes this specific feature \nso sensitive to human perception. If you scroll  \non Tiktok there are real men and women with this \nfeature, an increased canthal distance, from eye  \ncorner to corner and unfortunately, this is the \nmost commented feature for these individuals,  \ngoing back to the idea that the eye \nspacing is a highly sensitive trait  \nbecause of links to health anomalies, \neven if they have nothing wrong with them.\nIn terms of physical aesthetics, the problem is \nnot necessarily the disproportionate distance of  \nthe eyes but the fact that the eyes often become \nsmaller, beadier to fit within the bone structure.  \nAs with any facial feature, a deviation too far \nfrom the normal becomes unusual, and as many  \npieces of research have time and time again shown, \nthe most statistically average value is often  \nthe most attractive. The established average that \ntrauma surgeons use is 28-38mm for both sexes,  \nfrom Freihofer 1980. Bouhadana 2022 shows \nfrom 22,000 patients and 118 ethnicities  \nthe average distances, where chances \nare, if you fall outside of this range  \nfor your ethnicity, people may notice \nor comment on your eye spacing.\nOne of the reasons why this is such a sensitive \nfacial feature that people notice is because 78%  \nof the adult eye spacing is determined by 1 year \nof age and increases very slowly from there on  \nout. Meaning that not only is it determined from \nbirth but also an ecologically honest indicator  \nof genetic quality, it’s not something that can be \nchanged or hidden with makeup and surgery here is  \ncomplex so this feature is essentially you, and \nthat’s why it’s the first thing observers pick  \nup on to define a face as we see in the Tiktok \nexamples, even though they really shouldn’t.\nPamela M. Pallett and colleagues \nused four experiments to obtain  \noptimal length and width ratios that maximize \nfacial attractiveness. If you remember,  \nthe statistically average value \nfor any feature dental or facial  \nis often the most attractive because it \nis genetically the least variant option.\nAttractiveness scores followed a curvilinear \nfunction with the width ratio. Meaning that  \ntoo wide set or too narrow set eyes are both \nconsidered lower than a range of normal values,  \nthat 28-35mm that most of \nthe population falls into.  \nIn this graph, there is surprisingly \nstrong correlation and we see this  \ntrend in a lot of other studies for facial \nfeatures, so I consider it quite valid,  \nand intuitively we can all agree that length \nratios of .52 and .35 are just too much.\nAs for experiment 1 & 2, the researchers \nsystematically varied the length ratio by altering  \nthe vertical distance between the eyes and \nunsurprisingly there is also a range of midfacial  \nlengths that perform better than others. A lot of \nwomen especially get philtrum tucks and lip lifts,  \npresumably to approach a more harmonious length \nratio. This isn’t a cultural beauty standard,  \nthere is strong preference for marginally \nshorter midfaces in both the east and west.\nMore than meets the eye by Sanjay Naran and \ncolleagues suggested that African and Asian  \nethnicities were more likely to perceive decreases \nin submissiveness, threat, intelligence and  \nattractiveness with widened distances. Respondents \nbetween 18-25 were highly sensitive to the  \ndistance of the eyes and most interestingly, an \neye spacing 10% more than normal were rated as the  \nmost attractive for women. This supports the other \ngraph where 10% from normal falls into this range\nAll of this is to say that when the \ndistance between the eyes is roughly  \naround the range of 46% of the entire facial \nwidth, it will be rated high on the attractiveness  \nscale. This does not mean that if you don’t \nmatch this exact number you cannot be attractive,  \nthat is not what the study is controlling \nfor, but much like betting on a horse,  \n46% is the safest bet for producing an attractive \nface which is still attractive but the study  \ndoesn’t control for eye sizes. Marginally wide \nset eyes are typically larger like Anya Taylor Joy  \nwho fits this 10%+ deviation. Larger eyes are \noften considered a feminizing facial trait  \nbecause men due to sexual dimorphism have \nsmaller, more well protected eyes. Eyes  \nthat are too wide set however, start to become \nsmaller, almost beadier due to reduced space.\nOne thing to note with eye spacing. The first \nstudy didn’t control for eye sizes which often  \nincrease with width and benefit women, the second \nand third study were not balanced for males and  \nfemales participants but we can appreciate \na general trend. Most attractive women in  \nthe modelling industry do have slightly larger \nand often more spaced eyes than the opposite.  \nMen similarly also have more spaced eyes than not \nspaced with greater horizontal width as opposed  \nto vertical. While there exists an optimal range \nfor aesthetics as with most things, a touch above  \naverage is often the best for standing out. \nRealistically, there is not much you can do  \nto change this spacing other than surgery. You can \nlengthen your eyebrows to be more proportionate to  \nthe distance, or you can get a canthoplasty \nwhich is a relatively less invasive surgery  \nto change the appearance of where the eye starts \nand ends but doesn’t actually move its location.\nIf you want more personalized advice for your \nsituation, order an aesthetics assessment from our  \nin-house team of doctors to consider all of your \noptions if this is something that concerns you.\n1"}]}

19 but with\nno luck men often stare at my ugliness\nor don't stare at all i got into college\nand grew a crush on a colleague whom i\ngave my number to they didn't ask for it\nonly for me to find that he trashed it\nin the bin later that day that was my\nfinal straw i got into an even more\ndepressing mindset everything hurt twice\nmore and i started researching for\nplastic surgery options\nchapter 3 my surgeries i traveled 12\nhours to another country to get my\nsurgeries done\nit's been 4 months since i got a nose\njob surgical lip lift jawline\nenhancement and some chin enhancement\ni'm still healing it takes many months\nfor my face to adjust to the reshaping\nprocess especially the surgical\nprocedures but i have already gotten\nextremely beautiful it may not be your\ntype of beautiful but i don't hate\nlooking into the mirror anymore chapter\nfour my experience with suddenly not\nbeing ugly anymore it feels like my soul\nwas put into a new body a new life i'm\nnot used to this yet but i will try to\nput everything as much as possible in\nsimple terms i'm not invisible anymore\nand people are not disgusted when they\nlook at me\ni started work in a new place after my\ninitial recovery phase and people\nstarted to give me more attention my\ncolleagues are very friendly always\ninvite me for drinks people hold the\ndoor for me ask me to sit next to them\nin the cafeteria and there's no other\nseats available instead of waiting for\nsomeone to get up like i used to in my\nprevious workplace this could all be a\ncoincidence but i also have two of my\ncolleagues who are romantically\ninterested in me for the first time in\nmy entire life this change has been\ntwo-sided and i still can't adjust to\nall of this in the past if someone\napproached me it has always had a\nmalicious intent such as doing their\njobs or tasks for them or something of\nthat nature but now people are\ninterested in knowing me beyond work\nmy social media game has never been a\nthing my face was just too ugly to be\nposted so my social media mostly had\npictures of really random things until i\nstarted to heal from my surgeries and\ntook a couple of selfies to post\never since one of my ex crushers who\nformerly rejected me started to talk to\nme more often compliment my looks and\nlater introduced me to his gaming group\nafter posting my selfies on instagram\nother women have complimented me in\nrandom posts things like you're so\npretty it's these things that make me\nfeel like my entire life has been\nchanged we tend to have the need to\nbelieve that most people are not as\nsuperficial as they seem but in the end\nthey really from reading her story her\nanecdote on the benefits of pretty\nprivilege it seems like to me she's\nactually\ntalking about all six types of pretty\nprivilege and if you're not familiar\nwith the six different types of pretty\nprivilege you can read this article but\ni'll just summarize it for you really\nquickly there's lookism which is\ndiscrimination based on your looks\nthere's norm violations where if you're\nattractive and you do something\nnaughty socially unacceptable then\nyou you get a pass for it because you\nknow it's like oh that [ __ ] he just made\nan accident whereas if you're\nunattractive\nthere's also the halo effect which most\nof you are familiar with if you're\nattractive which is a positive trait\nthen you must have all these other\npositive traits as well because why not\nand there's the beauty premium where\nbecause of her looks she may or may not\nbe getting paid more or more correctly\nshe's getting opportunities to be paid\nmore because now she's seen as more\nsociable she can get along better you\ncan network her way up to the top\nquality of life benefits which is\nbasically like people treating you\nbetter as you was talking about in the\nexample it's better for your mental\nhealth you live longer\nwhen i talk about beauty it's not\nbecause i'm obsessed with the topic of\nbeauty i could use my skills to talk\nabout any number of topics with as much\nscientific rigor and\nrational thought right but the idea of\nbeauty for me it's much deeper than that\ni want to give the disenfranchised when\nit comes to looks the least attractive\npeople a voice in presenting the way\nthat if society affects them right so\nyou've got these different pretty\nprivileges you got the double devil\neffect\nit's really not fair it really isn't and\nif i was in that position i too would\nfeel very bitter and angry at the world\nso when people try to denounce their\nvoices as oh you're just upset or you\nknow these things don't exist they're\nall in your head\ni think as as this channel exists it's\nto provide a voice to the\ndisenfranchised just like you would for\nracially oppressed groups just like you\nwould for sexually oppressed groups\nright gender gender inequality i think\nlooks inequality is also a topic that\ndeserves a voice right at least we\nshould present and look at the research\nand see what it's saying that's exactly\nwhat we're doing here summarize all of\nthis like we have into this article\nit becomes\npainfully apparent just how much pretty\nprivilege affects your life i will leave\nyou with this the benefits of\nattractiveness are not linear but rather\ncubic so what this means in reality you\nwant to read it read the full article\nwhat it means in reality is that if you\nmake a small improvement to your looks\nyou will get a much larger social\nbenefit out of it\nbecause the benefits of attractiveness\nare not linear so when you get out of\nwhere you put in\ni think that looks is a fantastic place\nto invest your time energy and effort\ninto because\nagain it's not where you expect you get\nmore in return"}]}

Asking Dr Mew Tough Questions"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "﻿Dr Mew: \nYou may have heard of mewing.  \nIt’s a set of facial exercises and habits that \nhas been blowing up in popularity over the last  \nfew years because it promises amazing facial \ntransformations for absolutely 0 cost and  \nrelatively low effort. Too good to be true \nor an actual scientific miracle, we caught  \nup with the inventors Dr John Mew \nand Dr Mike Mew to investigate.\n \nDr Mike Mew is an unconventional orthodontist who \nbelieves in an environmentalist school of thought,  \nthat facial development and thus beauty is \ninfluenced by your environment and upbringing. He  \nand his father pioneered the orthotropic idea that \ngenetic control of the face’s development is not  \nprecise and can be shepareded into an ideal form \nwith postural and therapeutic exercises.. Dr Mew  \nhimself describes these practises of \n‘mewing,’ an eponym of his last name,  \nas a sheepdog shepherding sheep with just the \ntongue, lips and cheeks alone, whereas traditional  \northodontics is a precise endeavour using \nfacial appliances to get perfect straightness.  \nThe best known mewing exercise is resting \nthe tongue on the back of hard palate of  \nthe mouth with lips sealed, which as he \nsuggests, is the natural facial posture. \n \nThere are plenty more exercises you can follow \nand add to your routine for mewing, but let’s  \nreview the scientific evidence first.\nDr Mew suggests in his own words that there  \nis no primary evidence for mewing but \nthere is plenty of secondary evidence.  \nIn simple terms, there are no direct scientific \nstudies conducted on the effectiveness of mewing,  \nperhaps because it is a slow process, but there \nis plenty of theoretical evidence to suggest  \nthat everything adds up to work. We know that \nmany orofacial habits such as tongue thrust,  \nthumb sucking an mouth breathing significantly \naffect young children’s facial development,  \nso the question I asked Dr Mew is why is Mewing \nso controversial or such a foreign concept.\n \nMewing is a controversial idea \nbecause if it is proven to be true,  \nit undermines many previously held fundamentals \nof orthodontics, such as whether misalignments  \nshould be treated by mewing exercises over time or \nby appliances much more quickly. What happens if  \nan orthodontist recommends mewing but it makes \nthe issue worse. Secondly mewing implies that  \nfacial development is to a degree controllable. \nThat you look the way you do because you didn’t  \ntry hard enough in your youth or that you were \nmisguided in your orofacial habits. Whether it  \nis proven to be true or not, it doesn’t harm you \nto keep your lips sealed while you eat and to rest  \nyour tongue on the roof of your mouth, so there \nis more upside than downside to mewing which is  \nwhy it is so popular on social media, it’s a \nDIY approach to an orthodontic problem. \n \nIn the interview, Dr Mew and I mention of three \nmain pieces of research that are significant  \nproofs for mewing’s effectiveness. Dr Weston \nPrice’s studies, Dr William Proffit’s studies  \nand Dr Egil Harvold’s studies, each one \nlooking at a completely different aspect  \nof facial development, but all tying back \nto the environmentalist school of thought,  \nthat facial development can be influenced \nby behaviours and environment. \n \nHere are the cliffnotes of \neach of their findings: \n \nDr Weston Price went off into remote indigenous \ntribes and found that people consuming  \ntraditional, unprocessed diets of tough fibrous \nmaterials had better teeth and tooth eruption  \nthan their modernised counterparts with \nsoft, processed diets. He also noted how  \nsimilar each face was to each other, implying \nthat every face more or less reached their  \ngenetic potential for beauty and there is \nless inequality in beauty for these groups.  \nOur takeaway from this is that diet does \nhave an impact on facial development  \nas the human face, like every other muscle and \nbone works on a very much use it or lose it basis.  \nMuch like how the body of a physical labour man is \nmore robust and adapted than that of a desk job,  \nsedentary man, the jawline of those with tougher \ndiets is on average wider, stronger and better  \ndefined. We call these facial traits robustness. \nThe jaw and thus the entie face become more robust  \nbased on diet which is a tick for environmentalist \northodontics. From the Weston Price foundation  \nthere are 20 dietary guidelines summarized from \nhis book and realistically some are unavoidable  \nand others are scientifically questionable, \nafter all his work is from 100 years ago. The  \nrecommendations to follow 1. Avoid soft, processed \nfoods, stick to single ingredient cooking\n \n2. Avoid refined sugars and carbohydrates \nsuch as white flour and rice.\n \nDr William Proffit found that facial development \nis influenced by a number of forces. He utilized  \nthe framework of an equilibrium theory, that \nteeth move when their forces are not in balance.  \nMore interestingly a low force for a long \nduration can move metaphorical mountains.  \nThe tongue resting on the roof of the mouth \nis a low force applied over a long duration  \nand Dr Proffit estimated that a minimum of 6 \nhours is needed daily of low applied pressure  \nfor some kind of movement. Very high forces over \nshort durations do not have as much of an effect  \nbecause of the gum’s shock absorbing \nnature during chewing.\n \nLastly, Dr Egil Horvarld performed some of the \nmost thought provoking experiments in the early  \n80s. By blocking the nasal airways of primates \nhe found that they adapted to mouth breathing  \nbut that this also changed their jaw and muscle \nstructure, arguably for the worse. Overtime, all  \nof the test monkeys with blocked noses diverged to \na different facial appearance than the unblocked  \ncontrol group. Human’s aren’t monkeys, but we’re \nnot that different either. It is well documented  \nthat mouth breathing is a detriment to facial \nattractiveness. It even produces a characteristic  \nlooking face called adenoid face, which is another \ntick for the environmentalist viewpoint, where the  \nmonkey’s and human’s mouth breathing behaviour has \nchanged their skeletal and facial structure. \n \nThese secondary research point to mewing being a \nviable concept, that the small forces generated by  \nlips, cheeks and tongue are enough to remodel \nbones and muscles. However, many clinicians  \nand lay people in general are still sceptical \nthat the tongue can generate the needed forces.  \nDr Mew counters this mechanicalistic idea by \ngiving the example of a patient he saw in Brighton  \nHospital once where a cyst expanded through \nthe bone to a huge size simply by the tiny but  \nconsistent pressures of osmolarity as salt moves \nfrom cyst to bloodstream and vice versa. \n \nHere’s the million dollar question, should \nyou add mewing to your daily routine?  \nDr Mew mentions that for mewing to be most \neffective, patients need to be practising below  \na certain age. In many cases below 6. He also \nplaces a hard limit on mewing for 25 and beyond  \nand suggests that Orthotropics is not ideal, it \nis really only better than the alternative. \n \nThe main takeaway that Dr Mew keeps emphasizing \nis teaching young kids from the age of 5 to keep  \ntheir lips shut, from when they eat, breathe \nand sleep. This is because, as he explains,  \nforms structural memory that eventually becomes \na habit. As humans are creatures of comfort,  \nno amount of training later on in life can build \nthe same structural habit and posture as that  \nof a young child who has been practising proper \northotropic form. People who have been say mouth  \nbreathing since childhood, have great difficulty \nin slipping out of these lifestyle habits  \nbecause their face, their structure \nliterally have adapted to best serve  \ntheir functional breathing pattern, as we saw \nin Horvald’s experiment with monkeys. \n \nThe misconceptions around mewing are numerous. \nMany people from the internet fringes of the  \nmanosphere, a cultural identity dedicated \nto male self-improvement use the unproveness  \nof mewing to promote their own products. \nIt’s like saying, see mewing get’s results,  \nI was right about that and showed the haters, \nnow buy my red light laser therapy for $4000,  \nbecause I was right about mewing wasn’t I. In \ndoing so, the idea and concepts of what mewing  \nis have become deeply diluted as you hear \nabout it from one bro scientist to another  \nwho themselves heard it from someone who \nhas 0 clue, much like a game of whispers  \nthe original meaning, message and function get \nlost in the process. As Dr Mew and I conclude,  \nMewing is only one piece of the puzzle, and it \nisn’t a replacement for traditional orthodontics,  \nit doesn’t work effectively at all ages and \nit isn’t the cure to your facial development.  \nThese are postural practises that everyone should \nbe using. You don’t expect to get brownie points  \nfor brushing your teeth, you do it because the \nalternative is worse. The alternative to mewing  \nwith poor postural development results in a face \nthat is unaesthetic. Functionally, there is no  \nmajor downside to mewing. In some cases of teeth \noverjet, pushing against the palate can make the  \ndifference ever more noticeable but for most \npeople, with more neutral skeletal patterns,  \nthese are low resting forces for the entirety \nof your life, they are habits not necessarily  \nexercises in which case it’s not an unnatural \nthing to be doing. Resting your tongue on the  \nroof of your mouth is not an unnatural behaviour \nand so the risks are comparatively low.\n \nAnecdotally, I interviewed Male Model \nKarl Kugelman a while ago, and during  \nthe conversation I asked him if he rests his \ntongue on the roof of his mouth naturally,  \nwhich he and many other models with well defined \nfaces indeed do but this is not scientific  \nevidence by any means.\nIf you want  \nto learn more about the specific mewing exercises \nand add it to your routine, we have drawn out a  \nshort protocol for you to follow from Dr Mew’s \nown lecture notes, and he indicates to me that  \nthey are releasing an app later in the year with \nall of the exercises for easier accessibility."}]}

jawline,\nand jawline.\nToday we have a tendency to gravitate towards\nextremes in all things, including faces.\nThe cephalometric beauty standards of dimorphism,\nproportionality, and harmony have not been\nabandoned altogether, but now we highly select\nfor facial definition.\nIn the West, food is made abundant for most,\nand so we may have moved to select for sharper\njaws and leaner bodies because it is ‘rare’.\nBeyond that, it also just looks ‘cool’\nto have a sharp jaw.\nWe also seem to find facial dimorphism attractive.\nThis, as we will see, has not changed much\nthroughout time.\nThe difference for today is, we especially\nlean towards dimorphic MALE jawlines, in both\nmen and women.\nAt least in the modeling and entertainment\nworld, sharp, squared jaws have that ‘wow’\nfactor.\nIt \nis \nnot easy to find the same jaw shapes 50-100\nyears ago.\nToday you can look on any modeling site and\nfind almost every other model has an incredibly\nangular jaw.\nA face that would have once been incredibly\nrare has become more common simply due to\nthe discoverability effect.\nModeling agencies have an easier time than\never finding hyper-attractive faces; they\nhave a selection bias for those ‘robust’\nfaces, and social media pools all of these\nmodels in one place.\nAll they have to do is look.\nIt would \nbe silly to think this discoverability factor\ndoes not influence beauty standards to some\nextent.\nThe faces that are ‘put out’ there are\nwhat we are going to be accustomed to as a\nrepresentation of the times.\nIn a sense, our modern beauty standard of\nwhat makes a good looking face is higher than\nin \nthe past.\nWhat are the differences between the two,\nif any?\nBesides the jaw morphology, there is also\nmore of a fascination with high cheekbones\ntoday.\nDon’t get me wrong, even in the early 1900’s\nyou will find many attractive actors and actresses\nwith high cheekbones; it is one of those universally\nattractive features.\n1920s-1960s actor Gary Cooper had a face that\nwould do well in the modeling/acting world\ntoday, with exceptionally high cheekbones,\na long ramus, and naturally arched eyebrows.\nStill, modern modeling standards almost solely\nselect for high cheekbones, lean facial contours,\nand sharp jaws.\nToday, the facial harmony and dimorphism of\nthe face are secondary to the bone prominence,\nwhereas 50-100 years ago looking characteristically\nmasculine or feminine was much more important.\nWe can see a sort of transition towards the\n1980s with beauty Icons like Brooke shields;\nshe had, and still has, a powerful bone structure\nwith strong dentofacial growth indicators,\na more squared off jaw, and high cheekbones.\nIf we soften her jaw outline to be more rounded,\nshe starts to look more like the girl next\ndoor type.\nBrooke still models to this day; as she has\nlost some of her buccal fat due to the natural\naging process, her face has started to resemble\nthat contemporary modeling standard.\nHer thick, dark brows also do lend themselves\nto today’s beauty standards.\n60s-70s European sex symbol & actor Alain\nDelon had a more rounded jaw shape.\nOf course, it was within reason and not compromising\non his facial masculinity, but the faces of\ntoday lie at the extremes of jaw sexual dimorphism.\nIf we alter his gonial angle to be lower,\nmaking his jaw more angular and tapered, he\nstarts to resemble some of the Westernized\nbeauty standards of today; think Brad Pitt,\nTom Cruise, jeremy Meeks, and Ian somerhalder.\nAgain, it is that distinction between classic\nfaces having ‘harmony’ & balance, and\nthe extremes in cephalometric morphology today.\nThese standards of facial leanness are even\napplied to women today, whereas the ‘classic’\nfaces of women were a lot more ‘filled out’.\nThere may have even been a tendency to look\nfor fuller cheeks and lower cheekbones in\nwomen; it gives a softer, rounder malar region\nappearance.Classical beauty standards of Western\nwomen shared things in common with the east\nasian beauty standards of today.\nSome core tenets of facial attractiveness\nhave remained throughout time, though.\nA paper by Doctor Bashour discussed some of\nthese factors like symmetry, dental occlusion,\nneoteny, neoclassical canonical proportions,\nand averageness.\nThere seem to be faults in these theories,\nthough.\nFor instance, facial symmetry may be connected\nto the main drivers in facial attractiveness,\nbut it doesn’t explain facial attractiveness\nby itself.\nSimilarly, averageness is a bit vague as research\nshows a distinction between prototypical averageness,\nand an average attractiveness face.\nThe prototype face results from math and averaged\nfacial measurements, while the latter face\njust looks like an average Joe.\nThere is one factor that does seem to have\nfirmly rooted ties to facial attractiveness.\nSexual dimorphism, or having characteristically\nmale or female facial features, has always\nbeen attractive.\nAlthough today our notions of ‘masculinity’\nand ‘femininity’ are less rigid, the underlying\nfacial morphology and attractiveness cues\nare hard to unwire.\nThe facial features we find attractive have\nnot changed much despite cultural acceptance\nof non-sex typical dress, representation,\netc.\nIn males, things like a larger jaw, thinner\ncheeks, wider chin, pronounced browbone, facial\nhair, thick brows, small eyes, thin lips,\nand wider nose all result from testoeronic\ndevelopment.\nIf we think of faces on a testosterone-estrogen\nratio curve, the extremely feminine and masculine\nlooking faces will lie at the extremes of\ntheir respective sex hormone.\nIn females, high cheekbones, smooth skin,\nlack of facial hair, shorter lower jaw, wider\neyes, raised thin brows, and lip fullness\nare sexually dimorphic.\nAs basic as it sounds, the biggest thing that\nmakes a classic face look different from today’s\nfaces are not even the actual facial features\nand proportions.\nSure, we have a more unrealistic perception\nof what a normal face looks like, and we also\nhave an obsession with sharp jawlines and\nprominent cheekbones, but that doesn’t mean\nwe’ve abandoned the core of what makes an\nattractive face.\nThe ‘classic look’ is simply different\nbecause the filming tech has drastically changed.\nAdditionally, the mannerisms and way actors\nand models presented themselves was a lot\ndifferent than today.\nThere seems to be a general change from deliberate\nposing to looking more natural on camera.\nWhile the ‘range’ of faces we deem acceptable\ntoday has expanded, what makes a classic face\nattractive is not much different than what\nmakes a contemporary face attractive.\nYou will find examples of modern looking faces\n50 years ago, just like there are some ‘classic’\nlooking faces today.\nThere are no hard rules here, being attractive\nis its own thing.\nLastly, the ‘Halo effect’ of being attractive\nhas always been a thing.\nBashour notes how attractive people generally\nhave more popularity, better mental health,\noccupational success, and confidence.\nIf you would like to get your face assessed,\ndiscover whether your face is more modern\nor classic, or just get an indepth look into\nyour face order a QOVES facial evaluation\nover at our website, performed by our in-house\nteam of doctors and dentists to help you achieve\nthat next big glow-up.\nAs always follow us on Instagram for bite-sized\ncontent and subscribe on youtube."}]}

by genetic quality if you\nhave dyslexia if you have neurological\nor pathological diseases then you will\nnot be accepted for donating sperm if\nyou have inheritable diseases like\ncystic fibrosis you cannot\ndonate sperm\nthis growing trend in political workness\nand far-left social media and don't get\nme wrong i'm quite left-leaning i do\nagree with all of this but this\nextremism that we're

this whole enterprise\nit's expanded greatly and at one point i\nthought that beauty was purely objective\nand then i thought it was purely\nsubjective and then you come to realize\nthat it's a mix of both but the\ndifference is that we fail to\nacknowledge the objective part of it at\nall\nand that's why you have this idea that\neveryone should be allowed to spread on\ntheir seed genetics should not be a\nfactor in whether or not you are allowed\nto pass on your inheritable diseases\nbecause who cares if you have cystic\nfibrosis everyone deserves the\nright of parenthood that's the far

cystic fibrosis and nothing\nagainst the disease is just an easy\nexample to speak of\nif the doctor were to recommend to them\nto not have kids then you can classify\nthat as eugenics but by doing so\nyou acknowledge that having that disease\nputs them at a disadvantage from a\nmating point of view it puts them at a\ngenetic disadvantage which is exactly\nwhat eugenics is it's correct your\ndiagnosis of eugenics is correct but you\nare also acknowledging some kind of\nobjective standard\nlooking through youtube and just my\nexperience of being a creator on this\nplatform i know very well what type of\nvideos will do well on youtube or in\ntiktok and it's usually the ones that\nhave kim kardashian in the name and they\ntalk about some kind of facial analysis\nif you don't believe me the entire\nchannel was built on photoshop analysis\nof you know like big celebrities and uh\ncalling out other people who love seeing\nthe misery of other people and that's\nwhy people

care about\nimproving their looks or understanding\nbeauty standards they just want some\neasy brain rotting filler they'll talk\nabout kim kardashian and be like ha i\nknew it she's using a bbl to

It is \nnot a stretch to say that facial fat can  \ncompletely change your look. \nWhat is facial fat/body fat?\n \nFirst, let's briefly explain what facial fat is. \nJust like the fat found around your belly, adipose  \ntissue gain is a natural process that results from \nan increase in energy intake, aka food. The body  \nfat we want to focus on is subcutaneous fat, \nbecause that is the type of fat found under  \nthe skin,; this applies not only to places like \nthe stomach, but the face holds subcutaneous fat  \nas well, especially around the buccal, or cheek \nregion. When we eat less food or exercise more,  \nwe lose that extra adipose tissue. In the same way \nthat losing belly fat causes the abdominal muscles  \nto ‘pop’, the exact same thing applies to the \nface. The difference is, it is mostly the bones  \nlike the jawline and cheekbones that we quickly \nsee ‘popping’, instead of a muscle. But this  \ngeneral idea of ‘depth’ and 3d-ness is what \nmakes an attractive face. The abs seem to have  \na lot more ‘depth’ as you lose body fat, and so \ndo the cheekbones, midface region, and jawline.  \nEven though we usually see photos from a 2-D view, \nwe can still pick up on that ‘depth perception’.  \nA face with more facial fat just lacks those \ncontours in the 3-D context. Coleman et al.  \ndiscuss the importance of considering \nthe 3-Dness of the midface region.\n \nHow does bodyfat affect face shape?\nEven moderate amounts of fat gain  \ncan completely change your face shape and \nattractiveness. Taylor Lautner loses a lot of the  \nangularity around his mid-to lower face. These are \nsome of the more obvious effects of weight gain:  \nan overall poofier face with rounded cheeks and \njaw. The zygion is the widest part of your face,  \nwhere your cheekbones are. When you gain body \nfat you lose whatever contours you had in that  \nregion. Usually there will be a slight ‘dip’ right \nabove and below the cheekbones at the temporal  \nregion. A lean face will have more contours and \nbe more shapely and angular. This is most easily  \nseen in the mandible as you lose weight, but the \nsame concept applies to all areas of the face.  \nSince we tend to gain facial fat around the \nmidface region and jaw, extreme cases of fat gain  \ncan completely change your face shape, causing \nall sorts of facial contours and proportions  \nthat do not really look natural. Chris Pratt had \nan incredible weight loss journey and his facial  \nattractiveness improved a lot as a result. We \ncan see that his face just lacked angularity, and  \nnow it is a lot more striking. Like we mentioned \nearlier, there is a 3D aspect to his face  \nthat is also night and day. His buccal region \nwas a lot more ‘plump’ beforehand; the loss  \nof facial fat helped accentuate deep contours \nand valleys around his cheeks, undereye region,  \nchin, and glabella/brow area. The jaw especially \nhas a lot more ‘depth’ and shadows around it. \n \nChris’ Facial Width to Height ratio went down a \nconsiderable amount as his cheeks slimmed down.  \nThis can affect perceptions of masculinity, \ncreativity, aggressiveness, and dominance,  \nbut it is not that big of a difference in this \ncase. His face just looks taller and less bloated.  \nPlaying around in liquify, we can sort of \nmanipulate the weight loss/gain just by  \naltering the facial width and facial contours; \nit is not perfect, though. \n        \n \nHow does gaining facial fat \nchange my facial proportions?\n \nA face from this study by Rule et al. was altered \nto show a reduction in BMI. Personally, the edit  \ndoes not seem to do a good job of showing that \nweight difference, but one major proportion did  \nchange. The eye spacing changes a decent amount, \nin that the interpupillary distance, or distance  \nbetween the eyes, now makes up more of the facial \nwidth after weight loss. In essence, losing facial  \nfat makes the eyes appear wider set, and larger. \nDerek, from more plates more dates also achieved a  \nsimilar effect; his face seems slimmer, eyes seem \nlarger, and even his jaw is proportionally wider.  \nAn overlooked aspect of facial attractiveness \nis retaining a wide jaw and compact midface  \nappearance, despite the actual face being \nslimmer. That comes down to bone structure,  \nwhereas most people can achieve a wide jaw and \nmidface if they just gain a lot of fat. This guy  \nis an even more exaggerated example of this. This \nis because when we gain fat around our cheeks, our  \nbizygomatic width, or how wide our face appears \nincreases. Your face just gets ‘bigger’. This can  \nsometimes work to your favor if you have really \nclose set eyes that throw off facial harmony;  \nlosing weight may help offset it. Conversely, \ngaining weight may help offset overly wide set  \neyes. This guy made some drastic improvements \nin all parts of his face. His jaw got way more  \ntapered, with a now discernable jaw frontal \nangle, whereas his jaw was round beforehand.  \nHis cheekbones now appear high and pronounced. \nThe excess adipose tissue around the cheeks  \nmake the under eye region look hollower and more \nset back than it actually is. After weight loss,  \neverything seems to even out more, while at the \nsame time adding that element of ‘depth’. The  \nbuccal region and infraorbital region, or simply \nput, the midface, just appear way less pudgy;  \n‘pinchable cheeks’ are a real thing. Since fat \nreally likes to go in these areas, they are also  \none of the last areas to lose fat. Will Smith’s \ncheeks looked a lot more defined even after 20lbs  \nof fat loss. Similar to the guy before, Derek \nachieved a more tapered and defined jaw by getting  \nbelow 10% bodyfat; his jaw went from a rounded \nshape to a harmonious angle of inclination,  \nall from about 70-80lbs of body fat loss. These \ntypes of transformation extremes are hard to come  \nby as most people won’t venture that low. \nHow does gaining fat affect the side profile?\n \nJust like the front view, losing facial fat can \nmake a huge improvement in your side profile. In  \nmajor transformations, a person could essentially \n‘find’ their jawline. This guy goes from no  \ndiscernable gonial angle or jaw whatsoever, to a \nclearly visible mandible, ramus, and jaw outline.  \nBeyond that, his submental cervical angle, \nor the angle his neck makes with his jaw,  \ncompletely changes. This is actually quite an \nimportant feature when it comes to perceived  \nattractiveness, probably because it is strongly \ncorrelated with body fat levels and forward growth  \nof the jaw. Research by Naini et al. show strong \ncorrelation between this angle and the facial  \naesthetic/attractiveness of a subject. An angle \naround 95 degrees is most pleasing, basically  \nthat firm and taught ‘look’ where you do not have \nhanging skin or fat. Liposuction or fat loss can  \nlower this measurement by a good amount, even up \nto 20 degrees. An increase of this angle resulted  \nin lowered perceived attractiveness. Usually \nhanging neck skin/fat is associated with both  \naging and body fat gain, so it makes sense. A \nstudy by Coleman et al. talks about the aging  \nface, and we will probably have to make a whole \nother video on that, but decreased jaw definition,  \nfacial jowls, and a turkey neck are all common \naging signs. The study even touches on the  \nmentocervical angle worsening as the hyoid bone \ndescends and the region below the jaw just seem to  \n‘droop’. Since a defined jaw, and firm neck region \nare youthful features, fat gain can actually make  \nyou look older if the region below your jaw \nbecomes too undefined. On top of this, a leaner  \nface just looks more youthful in general. Being \nat a healthy body fat percentage will optimize  \nyour hormonal profile & general health; your \nskin, hair, eyebrow density, and general health  \nindicators should improve as a result. \nSo, How much weight should I lose? \n \nWell, it is actually not that simple. In a paper \nby Nicholas Rule and Daniel E. There were some  \ninteresting nuances found with how weight affects \nfacial attractiveness. The simplest thing to note  \nwas that adiposity(aka your body fat levels) is \nstrongly correlated with facial attractiveness.  \nUnderweight and Overweight faces were judged \nas less attractive than those with healthy BMI.  \nThe slightly discouraging takeaway from this \nstudy was that while people can notice even slight  \nweight changes in your face, it takes a lot more \nweight gain to change your facial attractiveness.  \nThis does kindof make sense, as facial \nfat may be one of the last places to go.  \nMost of your body fat is held below the shoulders; \nyou have to lose a significant amount of body fat  \nto really ‘show off’ facial gains. Most models \nare at the low end of the normal BMI range,  \nor even sometimes underweight; this certainly \nbrings out the bone structure for the  \n‘runway’ look, but may not always maximize \nfacial attractiveness. To appear lighter,  \na subject only had to lose about 1.3 BMI, but to \nappear more facially attractive it was about 2.5  \nBMI. But the paper did not extend outside of the \nscope of North America, and it is well researched  \nthat cultural influence can affect the weight \nto facial attractiveness relationship. \n \nLei et al. found that fat mass really only seems \nto affect facial masculinity in underweight men.  \nBasically, facial fat can add some masculinity \nif a man looks overly gaunt or emaciated; we  \ndo seem to prefer defined, masculine faces in the \nWest, but an overly gaunt face can signal illness,  \nlack of food, and fragility, all of which are not \nattractive. Sometimes, losing weight is not the  \nbest ‘looks maxx’; being at a normal weight is \nalmost always going to be more attractive than  \neither extreme. While losing some extra weight \nwithin that normal range may add that ‘boost’ in  \nattractiveness, there are trade offs to consider. \nA person should really consider their mental  \nstate and reasons for losing weight. It is well \nresearched that improving one's attractiveness  \nis a much larger motivator when it comes to weight \nloss than the actual health improvements. There is  \nnothing wrong with that really, but if you are \ntunneled in on the attractiveness part, you can  \ncompromise on your mental and physical health. \nThis model may look good in both photos, but  \nshe has noted her struggles with her body image \nand weight journey. Her face is arguably more  \nattractive in the left photo as it is slimmer, \nmore feminized, and more angular. However,  \nthe difference is not make or break, and certainly \nnot worth developing an eating disorder over. This  \nis an issue within the modeling industry where \nmodels, and even ourselves, have been conditioned  \nto associate these extremes with beauty. While, \nyes, being lean maximizes facial attractiveness,  \nresearch would not seem to support the extremes \nof Western modeling standards. Lastly, weight loss  \nwill look different for everyone. Your underlying \nbone structure will determine how contoured and  \nangular your face looks at the end, and every \nstep of the way. Some faces look a lot leaner  \nthan others despite being higher body fat. Losing \nbody fat is probably one of the most worthwhile  \nlooks maxes, especially for those that are \noverweight. The 9-12% range for men and 17-20% for  \nwomen generally maximizes facial attractiveness, \nwhile a bit above that will also do a comparable  \njob. Getting above 16-17% or so for men and \n25% for women may start to detract from facial  \nattractiveness, but everyone is different. Other \nchannels probably can give a more detailed rundown  \nof how to best go about losing body fat, as \nit is out of the scope of this video. \n \nIf you would like to get your face assessed, \ndiscover how your body fat percentage affects  \nyour face or just get an indepth look into your \nface, order a QOVES facial evaluation over at our  \nwebsite, performed by our in-house team of doctors \nand dentists to help you achieve that next big  \nglow-up.

you\nknow aren't necessarily\npretty to other people\nno\nthat's not how it works in in runway\nit's still very much dependent on the\nheight\nthat's just how it is that's just how it\nis it's dependent on height oh well\nactually not just height but also the\nlook and i think i'm 90 sure she is a\nmodel she just has to look very strong\ninto facial structure very strong bone\nstructure very much the model s look at\na lot of those model s features\ni also think he is the model because um\njubilee likes to do this thing where\nthey just get the least and the person\nyou would least expect and they're\nalways the model um\nso they're never the odd one out and\nthat's why i think he's the model as\nwell i think she\nshe\num and him and her models but i think i\ndon't think she she's the model even\nthough um\nshe's wearing heels and she's quite tall\nbut i just don't think she has the face\nfor it\n[Music]\nokay i'll just turn that to normal\nshe was a little bit shorter which\ndoesn't really mean anything but for me\nthat was like red flags\ngood luck y'all no she's definitely\ninvolved she's she's got the look\nit's that face honey it's the face i\nmean\ntalking about face is not important yes\nit is give us\nwhere okay\nabsolutely okay no\nall opinions cancelled charlie can\npersonally i think that's the best walk\ngo go go go go go go go giving us la\nmodels giving us division modeling\nagency\n[Music]\nthere's certain elements to the walk and\num\nit's just so funny to me that uh when\npeople think of runway modeling um when\npeople think of modeling just in general\nthe first thing they think of as though\nis the modeling walk\nwhereas in the industry it's just such a\nbig industry there's runways like less\nthan i think it's like less than five\npercent of that the actual revenue that\ncomes in\num and it's like less than five percent\nof book jobs so\nit's such a small part of the industry\nbut it's the most salient it's the most\nnoticeable part of the industry that's\nwhat everyone cares about it's just\nfunny to me so uh when you look at a\nwalk uh there's definitely no hips away\nand if you compare that to the shorter\ngill\nabsolutely okay look at look at how she\nsways her shoulders sorry keeps her\nshoulders straight but swears her hips\npersonally i think that's the best and\nthen this lady\nah there's no sway it's just like a\nnormal person\nalso she i don't think she has the\nmodeling look she has severe pragmatism\nand that you know an underbite in this\ncase\nand and for other reasons she does have\nsome other dental facial issues um that\ni think when you compare that to all the\nother faces here\nall of them have perfect dental facial\ngrowth very strong features very\ndeveloped features and there's you know\nno cosmetic issues\nbut even with her you know they're both\nafrican they're both there's another\nafrican lady i think she was mixed but\nthey all have very strong dental facial\ngrowth very strong features whereas\nshe\nshe um has a couple of pragmatisms and\nmale occlusion so jaw issues that you\ngenerally wouldn't see in the industry\nand thus you know that's that doesn't\nmean you can't be a model but\nwhen you have a thousand people that\nwanna be models they're obviously gonna\npick the ones with the least amount of\ncosmetic concerns and underbite that's a\nvery\nsignificant cosmetic concern i'm not\ngonna sugarcoat it for you\nlook at i mean just look at her um\nperfectly aligned perfectly aligned with\nthe forehead upper and lower jaw\nperfectly aligned very strong jawline\n100 a model um but the other lady the\none before she had she had some facial\nconvexity so her mid face was a bit\nsunken in actually one just show you\num so mid face is a bit sunken in that\ncauses the eyes to\nstart to droop a bit more um it's it's a\ncosmetic concern\nsomething a lot of people do get\ncorrected\num is that any better oh yeah actually\nhere and um yeah i think it's very\napparent now if you draw a line from\nhere to mid face to the jaw you can\nstart to see how the line would be um\nposteriorly positioned so it'd be\nstarting to slope backwards\nthat's not something you see with any of\nthe other faces and especially her very\nstrong dental facial growth very very\nattractive modeling face 100 you can\nimagine why should get in the shorter\nlady she's five five but you know\njubilee likes to do this thing where\nthey get the person you'd least expect\nto me it's not the person that that\ndoesn't fool me at all because i have\nplenty of experience in the industry i\nknow exactly how it works um\nand it is somewhat dependent on the face\nuh just because you have so much option\nperiod period period period yes\nabsolutely\nlet's talk shows\ni would just that guy could just not\nwalk at all and people would still be\nconvinced as a model he's just got the\nlook and um\npart of the look is just strong dental\nfacial\nbone development i think that's the\neasiest way i can explain it shows have\nwe been in um i did\nuh like it was called cornet fashion\nweek it was like\nokay for sure so we're both we're good\num yeah so i did coordinate fashion week\nbeginning of november i walked for five\ndesigners actually four because i got\nkicked out on those shows\nno i'm saying because i wasn't tall\nenough like it would literally give\nsasha the chance you might not be a\ntypical runway model but you said you do\nmacy's and dillards and that's kind of\nlike very almost like geriatric modeling\nlike anybody can do it like a grandma\ncould walk those runways\nyeah\ngeorge\ngeorge thank you\nthank you now i don't have to get\ncancelled for saying that you can get\ncancelled\nso i was like cool that's runway\nexperience do you guys think that this\nwould be based on a technicality because\nwe all seem like we have some runway\nexperience i mean not to be a bit bold\nbut i think i should us me yeah\ni was going to say the same thing i feel\nbad just it's the height for me i just\nlike since i've been kicked out and i'm\nlike five nine your walk isn't that's a\nvalid point yeah that's a valid point\nbut um regardless she needs three bucks\nher story i think choppy people are more\nwilling to overlook the height yes there\nare opportunities um in favor of the\nface and uh that's just a newer trend\nthat you see in the industry and i don't\nthink that it's a standard yet\nlike anyone can um when you look at the\nfaces i think\nattractive\num\nexcept\nlike\nwhen you see everyone's faces um\neveryone has a modeling look and uh\nthat's not to say that anybody's\nunattractive but sasha\num\nshe she doesn't have the modeling look\nis the easiest way to explain it\ni love girl\nplease raise your hand if you want to\ncontinue playing the game\nyeah\nthat's what i'm talking about\nstarting now for every time all of you\nvote out someone who's not the mole the\ntotal prize money will be reduced\ni mean i only wanted to keep playing\nbecause i wanted to keep playing i think\nwe found them look at you\nguys and now we're getting deducted\nbecause i know i didn't i didn't see\nthat second part like i found it really\nlike hard in this industry because i\nfeel like they still have very like\nwhite stamp beauty standards like\nthere's just like the bringing your own\nmakeup to set people like i never come\nwith my hair natural that's a that's\nactually a really big thing and i've had\nsuch a different so just a comment i was\ngoing to make a video on this but it's\nuh it's called aesthetic labor in the\nindustry and a good example is um if\nyou're a person of color they often\ndon't have your makeup shade uh because\nthey only bring it for the because\nbecause when you think about it they've\ngot you know models from why all the way\nto dark and uh they generally seem to\npreferentialize\nis that a word they generally seem to\nprefer um bringing makeup for the wider\nmodels in the wider shades than for the\ndarker models so if you're really at the\nfar ends of the spectrum they won't have\nyour makeup shade so in that case you\nneed to get it done at home even though\nthe\num the client is paying for a\nuh\nwhat's it called a makeup artist uh you\ncan't take any benefit from that because\nthey don't have your shade same thing\nwith hair um african hair it's hard to\ndeal with not everyone can deal with it\nnot everyone knows how to treat it so\nagain a lot of african models do have to\nget it done at home and this is\nsomething i've seen and it's quite well\ndocumented it's nothing new but it's\npretty impressive that she mentioned\nthat so maybe i'm not so confident\nanymore maybe she does have some kind of\nexperience different like juxtaposition\nnow that i kind of have made the\ndecision for myself that i was going to\nshow up as myself and so the natural\nhair is just non-negotiable i forget\nwho's signed i'm signed tony agency who\nare you with everyone she was way too\nquick with the ansa i'm with la models\ni'm with nomad management uh ferrari\ntalent's a commercial and then i have a\nmother agent in new york coco she was\nvery quick with that answer\njust a bit in the interest of keeping\nthings short let's see who they come up\nwith\n[Music]\noh\nwe counted all the boats and we have a\ntie\nthe kura and sasha each of you has 20\nseconds to state your case so like i\nsaid i'm from vegas so fashion show mall\nis where i got my start i love modeling\ni love runway even though just to put my\ntwo cents out there i think the biggest\ngiveaway between all of the models is\nprobably the the walk\nbecause if we're talking about runway\nmodeling that is something that you\nwould need to know and um i think\nsasha's walk was by far the most\nregular um and when uh what's his name\ngeorge i think said something about\ngeriatric modelling that's that's kind\nof the impression it gave me as well um\nit's just very it's more like lifestyle\nmodeling where it's you know it's just\nit's kind of like a regular person they\nwant regular looking people they don't\nwant to like model tear face they don't\nwant those um extreme dental facial\ngrowth or bone structure like the other\nshorter lady whose name i forgot but you\nknow i think you're starting to get the\npoint in what they're looking for it\nchallenges me it's that connection it's\nthat you know being able to share with a\nloved one that really drives it for me\ni've been modeling for four years since\ni was 16. i have done a lot of traveling\nfor modeling i've been to beijing\nthailand i've met with agencies in tokyo\ni've been to new york i've been mexico\ncity here obviously\ni'm with agencies in miami i like i've\nbeen in this industry for a long time\nit's interesting they think dakota\nwhat's their reasoning\nif the lights turn green that means you\nhave voted them all out if the lights\nturn red that means the mole is still in\nthe box and you lose\nnow\ncan the mole please step forward and\nreveal themselves in three\ntwo\none\ni knew it george knew it all shouldn't\nhave voted for me sasha was the tallest\none there and she was great and she had\na great walk and she looks awesome so\nshe did not have her\nlast or she did the last pick i think my\nheight was not very good there is that\nstill like that preconceived notion of\nwhat a model looks like and i think that\nthis episode really emphasizes that we\ndo have a long way to go i definitely\nbelieve that she could model but the\nwalk was a little off for me tell it\ngeorge\nall right so there you have it let's\nlook at the comments really quickly\nlying is part of the game who is tyler\nto tell someone what their story is\ntyler made everyone very uncomfortable\nfor nothing\nyeah i guess i mean sure\nisa is one of the prettiest people i've\never seen girl you don't need a runway\nto validate you when you look like that\nthat's pretty funny i think for a lot of\npeople\num\nthe runway is is the highest form of\nbeauty validation\ni can see where the idea comes from uh\nfor me i think editorial in a big\nmagazine would be far more validating\nthan walking the runway because for the\nrunway it's more so just um height-based\nbut you know there is an emphasis of the\nface as well but for editorial it's more\nso face based and uh less so based on\nyour height because\nthe works that editorials do generally\ndon't need you to be standing up\nstraight like a\nthin stick now i feel bad for isa being\nvoted out just for a height when she was\nclearly a model by the way she carried\nherself and walked i think um\nthere was this other video i saw i think\nit's um the one where they compare\ninstagram models to uh actual models or\nlike runway models and\neveryone just um has this impression\nthat models just carried themselves as\nsome kind of elite uh superhumans you\nknow the superhuman group who just carry\nthemselves with grace and dignity and\nelegance\ni don't know if that's i can't really\nsay that's true just having worked in\nthe industry having met many people\ni wouldn't say that's entirely true but\nthat's the impression that people get\nwhen it comes to running modeling and i\nthink that's the impression that they\nwere using to judge these characters and\nso that's probably why um i think sasha\ndid carry herself quite well um even\nthough she wasn't the model she was a\nmole she that's probably the\nway that people are looking at it that's\njust my guess\num i'm glad that sasha won these models\nso up there and stuck in their own ways\nno i i that's\nnot true at all i thought they were\nquite grounded\ndakota was a bit annoying but i think um\ni can't believe dakota is an actual\nrunway model with that awful walker hang\non let's just look at her walk\ngo go go go go oh\nand why is she doing that thing with the\nhips like she's like bending her hips\ndown her back like downwards like she's\na slinky\nyou know that little jump at the end\nthere it's kind of like she's skipping\njust look at it one more time\nyeah it just looks like she's skipping\nand uh\nit's not the best walk but it's i think\nsasha's walk is worse so\nsasha's walk has nothing\nhe has no i didn't think my walk was to\nit right\ngood i definitely let nerves get the\nbest of me oh she was nervous\nfair enough i don't know if she was\nnervous\nanyway that's it for this video thank\nyou all for joining me as always let me\nknow where you want me to look at next\nand\ni'll cover it\n[Music]\nyou"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Video Title: The Truth About Sharp Cheekbones"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "﻿Qoves Cheekbones 101/Do you \nhave High or Low cheekbones?\n \n[In this episode…] \nOn this channel, I’ve noticed that a lot of the  \nnewer viewers don’t really know what I’m talking \nabout when I use anatomical terms like jaw ramus,  \nzygomatic bone or mandible body and partially this \nis because I’ve taken for granted what I expect  \npeople to already know since we’ve covered it on \nthe channel in the past. In this new series, we’re  \ngoing to bring back an old series called defining \nbeauty, but in a more newbie friendly format, so  \nthat you can revise what you already know or learn \na thing or two and see how certain anatomical  \nfeatures on your face affect your facial appeal \ngreatly. Today’s episode will be focusing on the  \nCheekbones. Since the zygomatic region has a \nbroad array of talking points, particularly we  \nwill just be focusing on the ogee curve and how \nwe can tell apart high vs low cheekbones. \n \nWhat do we mean when we say Cheekbones?\nFirst, let’s get some cheekbone terminology  \nout of the way that should help us as we \ngo through some examples. The cheekbones,  \nalso known as the zygoma, zygomatic bones, \nor malar bones, are a large bone mass that  \nlie around our midface region. They border \nother midface bones like the maxilla and  \ninfraorbital bones right underneath our \neyes. So, in effect, they are also midface  \nbones, but more towards the outer parts of \nour face. Because they are positioned higher  \nthan the maxilla(aka the upper jaw), they play a \nlarger part in how our eyes look and the contours  \nsurrounding the upper part of our midface. The \n‘Zygomatic Arch’ is the part of the cheekbone  \nthat is most identifiable by a layperson \nwho has no knowledge of facial aesthetics.  \nIt is the arch the cheekbones make with the \ntemporal bones near the forehead, and the bones  \nconnecting to the lower part of the face. The \noutermost part of this arch is called the Zygion;  \nthis will also usually be where the widest part \nof the face is. Similarly coined, the gonion is  \nthe outermost positioned bone of the jaw body. The \nogee curve just refers to the outline, or ‘curve’,  \nthat these bones make on the face. This can be \nviewed from a ¾ profile, or front on. Usually it  \nis easiest to show the ogee curve in a ¾ profile \nbecause most people hold too much facial fat  \nto have a pronounced ogee curve in the front \nview. That elusive ‘hollow cheek’ look is not  \nas common as we make it look here at Qoves. Simple \nenough, alright let’s look at some examples. \n \nHow does changing the morphology of our \ncheekbones change the way our face looks?\n \nFirst off, we have model Corey Wallace. We can see \nthe widest part of his face, his Zygion, is very  \nhigh set right near the eyes. There is a lot of \ndistance between that point and the lowest part of  \nhis jaw at the Gonion. To really create that ‘high \ncheekbone’ look, there has to be enough distance  \nbetween these two points. We will see some later \nexamples of how a shorter face just cannot achieve  \nthis same look, even despite the zygomatic bones \nbeing higher up on their midface. The best way  \nto explain this is to think of a 300meter high \nmountain and a 600meter one. If you are climbing  \nmountain 1 and are almost at the top you would \nsay you are pretty high on that mountain. Still,  \na person almost at the top of mountain 2 is still \n‘high up’ on that mountain, but it is clear who  \nlooks higher side to side. To really create the \nillusion of height and depth with the cheekbones,  \nthe face has to have some downward dimension to \nit. A really short face just looks round no matter  \nhow high their cheekbones are. We’ve touched on \ndimorphic facial height in our Video, ``Why Zoë  \nKravitz Was Selected For Catwoman”. To sum up, \nshorter facial height is a feminizing quality;  \nsince men typically have taller faces, their \ncheekbones usually appear higher set and more  \ncompact relative to their total facial height. \nModel Paolo Roldan also has high cheekbones, with  \nlittle distance between his zygoma and his eyes. \nIf we soften his Ogee curve and make it less clear  \nhow high or low his cheekbones are, he loses \nsome of the ‘look’ western modeling standards  \nreally select for. Model Haejin Lee has less \nof a pronounced Ogee curve, and her cheekbones  \ncan be classified as ‘medium’ set. This overall \nrounds out her cheek area and face as a whole.  \nAltering model Marta del Cano’s high cheekbones \ngives the appearance of weaker dentofacial growth.  \nGranted, it was only on one side of her face, \nbut it makes all the difference in what modeling  \nagencies tend to look for. There are exceptions, \nthough, like model Nayara Oliveira, who has other  \nprominent dentofacial markers despite having \na less pronounced ogee curve. Her cheekbones  \nare quite low set and just lack that drawn out \nverticality. A simple adjustment goes a long way;  \nhere her cheek is less rounded and zygoma \nis higher set. We don’t want to go overboard  \nmaking the cheekbones protrude excessively or \nit can hurt facial harmony. Anarcius Jean has  \nmoderately high set cheekbones, and we can clearly \nsee how lengthy the ogee curve appears in contrast  \nwith Nayara. French model Lement chabernaud \nhas high cheekbones as well. One way we can  \ntell is that there is not much distance between \nhis eyes and the widest part of his face(aka  \nZygion). One thing we can do in photoshop to \naccentuate the ogee curve is to add some shadows.  \nTo be fair, this technique is used on almost \nevery single photo in the modeling industry. So  \nsome of this has probably already been done in \nthis next example. Here is English model Efosa  \nUwubomwen. Just some subtle shadows along his Ogee \ncurve makes his already high cheekbones look more  \npronounced. His Ogee curve makes up over 70% of \nhis midface height. This is another way you can  \ngenerally tell how high up the cheekbones are. \nLower zygomatic bones will obviously make up  \nless than half of the midface height. Even in \nthe side profile Efosa has extremely pronounced  \nzygomatic bones. Another model, Marc Schulze also \nhas medium to high cheekbones. Yes, I know it is  \ngetting repetitive seeing all these models, but \ndon’t worry some basic celebrities are coming too.  \nOriginally Canadian model Alyssah Ali also has \nhigh cheekbones, as we can see in her Ogee curve.  \nResearch by Liu et al. tried to understand how \ncertain facial features correlated with beauty  \nscores. High cheekbones positively correlated \nwith beauty. Low P values also would suggest these  \nfindings are significant. Looking young and heavy \nmakeup were also highly correlated with beauty.  \nInterestingly enough, the latter two would \nseem to tie into having high cheekbones.  \nMakeup can help accentuate the ogee \ncurve and appearance of the cheekbones.  \nAlso, a study by Diana Draelos \ntitled the ‘perceptions of beauty’,  \nfound high cheekbones as a universal beauty \nindicator across all skin colors, ethnicities,  \nand facial structures. She notes how estrogen \ninfluences the development of female cheekbones,  \nand thus high cheekbones are a strong \nindicator of reproductive prowess. This is  \nnot to say that Low cheekbones are inherently \nunattractive, but generally there is a reason  \nthat Western beauty standards seem to select \nfor ‘costly biological displays’. Even in men,  \nhigh cheekbones signal strong dentofacial growth \nand lean facial features. Without going into an  \nendocrinology lesson, Men also require estrogen \nin sexual development, regulation, and signaling.  \nA man that can afford to have higher estradiol \nlevels because it is in balance with his higher  \ntestosterone levels may also benefit from the \nreproductive signaling of high cheekbones. \n \nModel Zoe Barnard has high cheekbones, but they \nare not overly pronounced and so her Ogee curve  \njust looks a bit ‘flat’. This is not necessarily \nan unattractive trait; if we make her cheekbones  \nmore pronounced, it gives a bit of a KIm K \neffect. You can let us know which you think is  \nmore attractive; adding some cheekbone protrusion \ndoes seem to help her ¾ profile, but it is hard  \nto say exactly how it would harmonize with her \nfacial width in frontal view. It is not like she  \nhad bad cheekbones in the first place. We already \nknow high cheekbones are probably the single most  \nselected for facial features in the modeling \nworld. However, this is not exclusive to modeling.  \nA lot of the Hollywood movie industry also seems \nto select for high cheekbones. Of course it has to  \nalign with the character they are trying to cast, \nbut high cheekbones likely won’t hurt your chances  \nof acting. Chris Hemsworth has exceptionally high \ncheekbones; although they are not super pronounced  \ndue to his weaker facial definition, his \ndentofacial growth creates that lengthened,  \nhigh cheekbone, ogee curve. Changing his \ncheekbones won’t make or break his face,  \nbut flattening his cheeks does not help. In \ncontrast, giving him an Ogee curve similar to  \nSean O’ pry, who we’ll look at in a second, makes \nhim look more modelesque. Sean is an example of  \nthat 99.99th percentile high cheekbones; \nperhaps this is why he has had so much  \nsuccess in the Western modeling world. The same \ncan be said for successful model David Gandy.  \nShaving off some of Sean’s zygomatic bone makes \nhis cheekbones look lower, less masculine,  \nand less sharp. Mauritian model Shawna Blackburn \n, from mixed east African Island Mauritius,  \nhas somewhat medium to low cheekbones, and \nan overall shorter facial height. Making her  \ncheekbones more compact and higher set changes her \nlook significantly. Another popular face today,  \nChris Evans, also has very high cheekbones. \nIt is a common theme for most superhero actors  \nto have strong dentofacial growth, with high \ncheekbones, wide faces, and strong jaws. \n \nSupermodel Adriana Lima has cheekbones that \nare incredibly high and prominent. Again,  \ncheekbones like this are so rare that she can \nprobably attribute a lot of her success to them.  \nThe widest part of her face is so \nclose to her eyes, and her ogee curve  \nalmost comprises her entire midface height. Adding \nsome shadows further brings depth or 3-d-ness  \nto her Ogee curve. A study by Linkov et al.in the \n“Aesthetic Surgery Journal”, sought to study the  \ndesirable midface position of female subjects. In \nshort, the distance from the pupillary line to the  \nmidface is a strong indicator of youth. It is no \nsecret then why high cheekbones are so attractive.  \nAdriana has that ‘lifted’ bone structure \nappearance, with minimal distance from her  \nmidface to her eyes; thus, she will likely age \nbetter than someone with lacking midface bones.  \nA midface lift can have a powerful effect on how \nyouthful your face looks. The researchers note  \nhow a defined S shaped Ogee curve is important \nin an idealized, heart shaped,youthful face. \n \nA prerequisite to seeing if your cheekbones are \nhigh or low is to not have a high amount of body  \nfat. Actor O shea jackson jr is a counter example \nof this. On top of already poor dentofacial  \ngrowth and low cheekbones, high amounts of \nfacial fat just flatten his cheeks. Lastly,  \nwe have model Saffi. She also has some more \nfacial fat than some of the previous models,  \nbut prominent cheekbones and favorable body fat \ndistribution make her Ogee curve still visible.  \nPhotoshopping her low cheekbones to be higher \nand more compact gives her face a slimmer and  \narguably more harmonious result. There is a \nnoticeable difference in what Eastern Beauty  \nstandards seem to prefer and Western standards \ndo. In the West, it is very common to see an  \nincrease in cheekbone volume and dimension \nthrough fillers and other surgeries. Eastern  \nbeauty standards would seem to look down on \nprominent cheekbones and prefer a softer,  \nmore rounded facial contour. They commonly opt for \nzygoma reduction surgery. \n        \n        \n \nIf you would like to get your face assessed, \ndiscover your cheekbone morphology and how it  \naffects your face or just get an indepth look into \nyour face order a QOVES facial evaluation over at  \nour website, performed by our in-house team of \ndoctors and dentists to help you achieve that  \nnext big glow-up.

attractiveness of\neight strangers of the opposite sex\nhalf were asked to look at original face\nshots while the other half viewed images\nthat had been digitally manipulated to\nadd scarring to the cheek jawbone or\nforehead while the scars made no\ndifference to the perceived\nattractiveness of the women scarred men\nranked 5.7 percentage points higher in\nthe appeal ratings than those with\nundamaged skin\ntheir results suggest that under certain\ncircumstances scars may advertise valued\ninformation about their bearers and that\nthe idea that scarring universally\ndevalues social perceptions can no\nlonger be assumed to be true so in other\nwords scars are not really a negative\nfor men they seem to actually advertise\nthat you've gone through some kind of\nhardship and you came out stronger and\non top\nnow let me reiterate what i think this\nmeans in much simpler terms some scars\non men give a certain level of character\nlike it gives you an edge a rebellious\nlook almost like a bad boy risk taker\nvibe and it's kind of does say a lot\nmore about you than you would expect\nmainly that you've put yourself out\nthere in a dangerous or risky situation\nnow whether that was for the right\nreasons or the wrong ones perhaps trying\nto defend a vulnerable person or you\nwere just trying to pick a fight and you\nlost that doesn't really matter the main\nthing is that you got out there and you\ndid something rather than staying in the\ncomfort of your own home or perhaps you\njust got that scar trying to do some\nhandiwork in your own home in which case\nit's best you don't tell people how you\ngot that scar\nthis idea is much the same with tattoos\nlike we've covered in our podcast\nepisode the perception of tattoos where\nwe took a look on the madonna\ndichotomy it's very common in literature\nthat women are either a madonna or\nthey're a and there's no in\nbetween and they're written as such and\nfollowing this patriarchal model\nbasically the findings were that women\nwith tattoos aren't considered higher up\non the social ladder compared to men\nwith tattoos where it's not as much of a\npenalizing characteristic and this is\nbecause of multifaceted reasons the most\nsimple answer for this video is that it\nis a masculinizing characteristic and if\nyou go back to early hunter-gatherer\nsocieties you're more likely to get a\nscar from hunting than you are from\nforaging for food and just because of\nthose gender roles it's become\nassociated with masculine traits that\nbeing said let's talk about some of the\ncelebrities who have used their facial\nscars to open doors define characters\nand explore different storytelling\nopportunities in very much unforgettable\nways now don't get me wrong here their\nskills have brought them the success\nthat they deserve and their confidence\nin themselves including their scars have\nmade them into legends take the example\nof the scar between joaquin phoenix's\nlip and nose that is quite visible i\nmean it practically had the second\nbuilding in gladiator it is known as a\nmicrophone cleft which is a mild form of\na cleft lip which means that he was born\nwith it and it has served his career\nquite well fitting perfectly into the\nroles in which he has played a tough\nmulti-dimensional character like 1999's\namm 2012's the master where we see him\nas a volatile world war ii veteran or\nwill everyone's favorite the joker his\nfacial scars give him the edge as a\ndangerous looking character i think it's\nsafe to assume that a female actress\nwith similar amount of scarring and\nfacial features would also be seen as a\ncutthroat character but you don't see\nthat as often in hollywood and i suppose\nthis is for some kind of patriarchal\nreason but it seems that the directors\nlike to keep the female leads face clean\nand a good example of this was with the\nbatman where robert patterson had a\ndecent amount of facial scarring but zoe\nkravitz had none and to me it kind of\ndownplays her role as batman's equal\nwhere she doesn't have as much scarring\nso therefore she's just serves as a\npretty face and eye candy whereas\nrealistically they should be very\ncompatible fighters who have gone\nthrough equal amounts of battles and\ntherefore have similar amounts of\nscarring but it's not a coincidence that\nzoe kravitz has perfectly clear skin\nanother example of scarring being used\nto male advantage is game of thrones\ncasting of jason momoa as the formidable\ncarl drogo which is arguably a stroke of\ngenius momoa's scars fit the role\nperfectly just as it would eventually\ncomplement his portrayal of the\ntrident-bearing heir to the throne of\natlantis in aquaman now the story behind\nthe scar also adds to the appeal as we\nmentioned in the study previously and he\nsaid in an interview that he actually\ngot it in a bar barfi in which you took\na pint of glass to the face it's quite\ninteresting that a scar something that\nmay commonly be seen as a negative can\nactually be used to your benefit in the\ncasting last example how can we forget\ntom hiddleston's forehead scar but\nhiddleston did perfect justice with this\nmoo charm and wicked smile and the scar\nvery much added some depth to the\ncharacter i know personally i wouldn't\ntrust somebody with a clean baby face to\nconvince me that has gone through many\ndifferent fights\nalso very interesting from an aesthetic\nperspective to observe that in almost\nall action movies after fight scenes or\na car accident or what say you we can\nevidently see a fresh wound\nstrategically placed by the makeup\nartist on either one cheekbone like this\nso like doctor strange or two lips like\nhere\nnow this is strictly in no way or shape\nor form to make you men indulge in the\nidea of getting a self-inflicted wound\nto increase your sexual appeal\nscars do undeniably make many men look\nmore masculine and rugged and show that\nthey're able to overcome adversity but\nyou need to actually go through some\nadversity to overcome that\nself-inflicting wounds to look more\naesthetic is a very silly idea it has to\nmake sense with your character you would\nexpect an mma fighter or somebody who's\nreally into martial arts to have some\nscarring you wouldn't expect somebody\nwho plays pokemon go all day no no\ndisrespect to pokemon go but you\nwouldn't expect them to have the same\nlevel of scarring or for the same\nreasons not all scars are built the same\nand oftentimes as women rely more on\nemotional connection rather than\nphysical attraction\nthe story that goes with the sky is the\nmost attractive part of the whole\naesthetic itself if you say that you got\nthe scar from falling off a log trying\nto catch some pokemons it's very\ndifferent to saying you got this guy\ntrying to defend a young lady as a\nsecurity guard working as a bouncer one\nday\nin a 1988 study by shannon life\nhistory's blood revenge and warfare in a\ntribal population it is noted that\npost-traumatic scars that are acquired\nthrough combat or other heroic behaviors\nmay also serve to advertise value traits\nfor example yanumamo men of the tribe\nfrom venezuela often shave their heads\nand rub red pigment into their scalps to\nincrease the visibility of their scars\nthus demonstrating their bravery and\nability to withstand and recover from an\nenemy's blow not all scars are made\nequal\nrynomir schmish that is such a tough\nword to pronounce but it's a german word\nmeaning bragging scars referring to the\ndays of academic fencing where men would\noften times wear these scars like a\nmedal\nthis wasn't that long ago either the\nlate 1980s people would crudely suture\ntheir inflicted cuts so that they could\nwear them like medals you wouldn't\nproperly heal the card you'd do it in a\nway that left a scar on purpose i don't\nknow if you've noticed this but most\nbond villains seem to have a scar and\nit's very much the same idea here they\nwear it like a metal so to sum things up\nfor you what have we learnt here boys\nand girls basically facial scars are\nperceived by women as an attractive\nquality for short-term relationships\nbecause they find it to be a symbol of\nmasculinity a feature that is linked to\nhigh testosterone levels and an\nindicator of good genes but also they\nshow that you can overcome difficulties\nin your life and come out on top now men\nwithout scars however could be seen as\nmore caring and therefore more suitable\nfor long-term relationships and this is\nsomething

um\nnothing too serious we're just going to\nbe\nanswering more or less what the\nquestions you guys have about um\nwell you can talk about really anything\nyou want facial aesthetics related but\nwe want to keep it themed towards the\nidea of um\nthis concept of there being a less\nattractive uh sibling so that's kind of\nwhat we're doing\nright um\nso just give me a moment i'm\ni'm just gonna bring jc on\nuh right now so\nif you guys are from the discord server\nnice to have you here\num\njust give me one moment i'm gonna invite\njc\nhe's is running a bit late today\nbut yeah have your questions in the chat\nif you haven't joined the discord\nalready that's something i highly\nrecommend you should be doing\num\nbecause\nit's very active it's surprisingly\nactive and\nthe the amount of people that provide\nreally good quality content is\nit's pretty staggering is um certainly\nwasn't expecting it so it's good to see\neveryone here\nwelcome it's going to start in five\nminutes\nso i can get jc on\nand hopefully we can talk about the less\nattractive sibling effect\ni don't think it's an effect i think\nit's just something that kind of happens\nbut\nnonetheless makes for something\ninteresting\nhow do i stop being single\num\nthat's a tough one to answer it depends\non a lot of things\ngenerally i mean i don't want to tell\nyou just go out there and meet people\nbut if you're not going out there at all\nthen what do you expect you're just\ngoing to meet people out of nowhere\nbeing attractive does help but\nmeeting people is is a far more\ncomplicated answer than that and i think\ni don't think this is the right channel\nto help you with that there are better\ndating channels that can give you better\nadvice uh just just one thing just make\nsure that the audio is good everyone\nit's just let me know if uh if you want\nme to boost the audio or everything's\nfine\najc uh\njust start we've already started the\nstream so just like five minutes in just\nwaiting for you\nokay so so sorry apologies for that\num\num so hopefully everyone can hear us uh\nthe discord invite in the description is\nbroken okay there's one in the um well\nthere's one in the chat as well uh we'll\nlook at that in a second\num so jc we agreed on this last week\nthat we're gonna be talking about the\nless attractive sibling so i'm basically\nuh i kind of\nso firstly i found this subreddit um i\nfound this uh not the subreddit i found\nthis read read it here uh read it post\nabout to the least attractive siblings\nout there how did you guys find out\nwhich i found pretty funny um then\nthere's also this article which i\nthought was just completely\num\ncompletely crazy uh can you are you\nwatching the stream or are you on\ntwitter yeah i'm i'm looking at the\nscreen\nyeah\nokay cool um so\nthis article this article is pretty\ncrazy um 15\n15 celebs you didn't have siblings uh\nand then\nthe and the thing is it says here celebs\nwho have the ugliest siblings which is\njust such an out-of-pocket description\nof\nyeah it's pretty crazy but um i i think\nit's a good starting point for us to\ntalk about um\ndoes anyone in the chat have any\nexperience with being the ugly sibling\nand i don't like using the word ugly\njust let's just say less attractive\nsibling it could you could just be\naverage and your uh sibling could be\nreally far beyond average uh\nand how was that experience i'm curious\nfor the people that uh that do have that\nexperience how was that\nexperience different for you yeah\nso\nsome people um are saying well well\nfirstly let's look at the uh frank sorry\nthe jonas brothers um yes so\nyou can see this right uh which one\nwould we say is uh\nthe the most attractive the least\nattractive\nand\nwhat are we what are we going to talk\nabout this for for the jonas brothers so\nyeah so the jonas brothers uh\nmany of you guys know um\nand i i see a lot of you uh what\nis this uh asada\na single black female ash van lee i\nrecognize that name um\nuh who do we know as the i guess least\nattractive jonas brothers so the main\nthing is everyone gives kevin jonas kind\nof like\nthe kind of like afterthought yeah um\nand there's been some long-term kind of\nthings that i'm sure kevin has gone\nthrough uh there was a couple stories\nwhere\nuh\nkevin jonas tells the story of\na girl holds up a sign\nand it was saying like\nkevin uh it was saying no it was saying\njoe you're really hot\nnick you're really cute and kevin you're\nall right\nand so\nuh i can't imagine you know yeah just\nkind of like doing it i mean\nlook he doesn't look that bad yeah it\ndoesn't look you know\num so so just just for the people who\ndon't know do you want to tell us who's\nwho\nokay so on the far left is joe jonas and\nin the middle is nick jonas and on the\nfar right is kevin jonas yeah\nif if you were to look at kevin jonas um\nby himself\ni think and you didn't have any context\nof him being like\na jonas brother\nyou know i i think he he he's not an\nunattractive guy you know yeah but it's\nthe fact that you're comparing him with\nhis brothers that makes it kind of like\noh okay you know what i mean it's like\nyeah no i mean the the thing is um i\nactually think he's quite attractive um\nyeah he's a good looking guy but like\nhis brothers i don't really understand\nthe hype with with the brothers\nthemselves i don't think i actually\npersonally i feel like they're very\nequally um ranked in terms of their own\nlooks like they're well\nwell here's the thing that uh you have\nto lump in is also talent weighs in big\nyou know big factor i i think people\ndon't realize like um yeah talent can\nsomeone look really attractive you know\nwhat i mean yeah yeah\nkevin jonas is not known for his solos\nyou know what i mean yeah yeah that's\ntrue that's that's a fair point um let's\nlook at some of the comments uh some\npeople said uh i think somebody said\nandrew garf garfield has a unfortunate\nlooking brother um so i'll just oh bring\nhim up right now andrew\ngarfield who said that brother which uh\num\ni lost the comment but somebody said\nthat um while we're on that topic uh the\nthe franco brothers so let's look at the\nfranco brothers first um\nuh actually\nthe thing is you gotta google third\nfranco brother cause there's like\nnothing on this guy\nthen um\nand then people just instantly know who\nyou're talking about uh this is the\nthird franco brother so\num\nis there someone more than james and\ndave\nis there a third franco brothers the\nthird franco yeah i think there's a\nthird franco brother yeah really yeah\nand um so again like the the thing is\napparently his is meant to be less\nattractive than the again i think\nthey're just equally matched in terms of\nlooks\ndid they hide him away in a closet like\nwhat's going on that's the thing like i\ni recently found out that um the the\nhadids have an older sister like um\nelena did i think her name is\nas well so\nyeah it's funny because you feel like do\nthey just lock these like yeah like i've\nnever heard of any of these um people\nbut\nwhat i think is interesting so these are\nall um they're all more or less similar\nlooking to each other and um i don't\nthink there's any like particular\ndifferences in in their aesthetic but um\none example it is yeah yeah\none example that i thought was really\ninteresting was uh this male model\ncalled tony muffwood and that's the guy\nin the thumbnail so um\nif you guys are wondering but tony\nmafford's brother is um\nhe's quite is quite interesting looking\nuh i wouldn't i wouldn't say it's like\nunfortunate like they're very similar\nthey're very similar in terms like in\nterms of bone structure but um one is\nhigher body fat level and uh this may\nnot seem apparent right from the get-go\nbut this is like the perfect example of\nyou know one attractive sibling versus\none less attractive uh\nsibling and uh\nin the meantime while you're bringing\nthat up catherine page the jonas\nbrothers on the left might be the most\nattractive\nor maybe the middle uh asada uh i like\nthe smart dudes\nokay\nyeah i mean uh because like the thing is\num i think this this one like a lot of\npeople have spoken about his brother and\num\nthe case is like i don't think he's\nhe has any different features to um tony\nhimself so this is the brother this is\ntony murphy who's a male model and\nphotographer\num an artist and he could work\nyeah he did get he did get some work\ndone but like in terms of bone structure\nthey actually if you look at like really\nearly photos and i'll see if we can pull\nthem up um there wasn't that much\ndifference so at one point um they\nstarted to like deviate in in like looks\nbut starting off they're more or less\nsimilar i think uh this is like a really\nearly photo if you guys can see oh\nbobby lully oh yeah we're gonna bring up\nbrad pitt's brother because that's the\none i told uh uh cougs didn't even know\nthat um yeah brad pitt had a brother oh\ngod and this is an interesting one um so\ni don't know if you guys remember\ncameron heron we made that video about\nhim um\nhe he was driving a ford mustang and he\nkilled someone you know street racing um\noh geez you guys if you guys saw what\nhis brother looks like\num\nthis is his brother let me just pull it\nup here\nthis is his brother this is cameron\nheron they're both related\nexplain that wow yeah\num\nso\nit really puts into perspective um well\ni wonder if it's that here's the thing i\nwonder if their\ndietary and\nhabits that they did in their life was\ndrastically different because\nuh you know i wonder if uh because rami\nmalek actually had an identical uh twin\nand at some point they like kind of\ndeviated okay from each other\nand then after that we're gonna do uh i\nthink bob lully talks about brad pitt's\nbrother we can bring up\nbob's suggestions\nbrad pitt's brothers uh\nit's uh\npretty that was a pretty obvious one but\nuh let's look at the romney malik one\njust yeah and see if we can find it\nromney brother um oh actually they look\npretty similar\nto be fair but they used to be virtually\napparently virtually identical wow yeah\nyeah yeah no i see it they're very\nsimilar but um\nthere's there's some deviation as they\nget older and i see what you're saying\nyeah um\nbecause one time uh apparently uh in\norder for um\nhis brother to get the a in the class\nrami pretended to be him in college\nuh and did a whole acting bit with him\nokay so i see a little bit of heavier\nbody fat so so somebody said uh the\nugliest is often the first child to be\nborn it must have something to do with\nthe genes um\nsee the thing is it it doesn't it um the\nwhat this reflects is something we've\nbeen saying for a while that\nattractiveness is like say like 60 genes\nand then 40 upbring nature versus\nnurture yeah it's like this for all\norganisms you know uh ever in existence\nuh there's a component that's inherited\nand then there's a component that is\nfor influenced by the environment that's\ncalled a phenotypical expression of your\ngenetic uh makeup basically and uh\ncertain genes are expressed certain\ngenes are\nused certain genes are not ever used and\nthat's purely dependent on the way uh\nyou're raised in your environment so\nyeah these guys\nyeah sorry yeah go on oh no no no uh i\nwas saying while um\nyeah uh let's bring up uh brad pitt's\nbrother [ __ ] important okay cool\nlet's see we got fire spawn cameron is\npretty\nuh\nwe got hot cream pie oh no\nno not that\nnot that good\nbrad pitt's brother uh yeah yeah he's\ngot he's kind of got the sim he's got a\nsimilar look\num\nbut\ni mean this guy's not on it like he's\nnot bad looking you know like\nno he's not bad looking but if you're\ngoing to be compared to being brad\npitt's brother i mean there's a standard\nof like this could be one of them yeah\nyeah no\nyeah that's actually\ndouglas\nyeah douglas pitt um\nso so the thing is like one of the\nthings i'm noticing here instantly is uh\nbrad pitt has has a far better jawline\nthan\nthe brother\nalso um since he has a better jawline it\nalso affects the mid face because\nthe the mandibular the maxillas the\nupper and lower jaws are very much um\ninterlinked with each other in terms of\nfacial development so if you have a good\njawline chances are you also have a good\nuh upper jaw and that also influences\nthe development of the eyes so with uh\nit seems like the eyebrows are more\ndeveloped on brad pitt\nthe eyebrows are also thicker as well so\nhe just that's that's just purely\ngetting lucky in the genetic lottery but\nuh in terms of facial development brad\npitt has a lot his development is a lot\nmore pronounced uh and that's what i'm\nguessing is perhaps they had some\ndeviations in their diet maybe one of\nthem um had some kind of blocked nose\nand that caused them to mouth breathe a\nbit more there's so many different\nfactors but uh you can see the stronger\nchin from uh oh yeah yeah 100 it's it's\nsuch a like the differences in bone\nstructure are just night and day and um\nthe\nbut you can still see that they're\nbrothers that's the thing that's uh\nlike there's yeah it that does not just\nmake you i just feel i just wonder what\nhe's going through\ni feel like he just doesn't tell anyone\nthat he's brad pitt's brother like when\nhe's on a date\ni mean\ni'm sure he's married and happy but like\nyou know at this point in life i don't\nthink it really bothers him that much\nit's it's kind of like you have an\nattractive brother he's done something\nin in the acting or modeling industry\nand you yourself you're just gonna do\nsomething in you know another field um\naltogether so you know maybe brad pitt\nhas the looks and you have the\nintelligence you can do something else\nwe we have jordan uh\njordan ma fumbo says brad pitt's brother\nlooks better than brad pitt the brother\nlooks more feminine than brad hey\nsomebody said nile de marco\nuh\nralphie wiggum my brother\ngot all the worst features and i got all\nthe best\nokay so now demarco um\nhere's the uh\ni think he's is the deaf um\nactor\nthat's oh really oh i i haven't heard\nthe name this this is uh he's got me\nright wait\ntwin brother oh that's his okay so this\nis his twin brother\nwait wait wait\nthis is his brother\nthis guy who who um the\nthe uh the redheaded guy is apparently\nhis twin brother\noh really crazy interesting oh um\nthere's there's no i think he's adopted\ncan somebody clarify that\num yeah can someone look that up to\nverify yeah i i think i remember\nsomething like this um i'm not 100 sure\njust like one of those memories uh tom\ncruise's brother so tom cruise brother\nhuh\ni mean they kind of oh that's really his\ntwin\noh that's crazy\nthat is easily the craziest example\nwe've seen so far\nthat is insane\nhuh\nso is that well something like genetic\nanomaly is that like\nsome some form of albionism\nit looks like a recessive redhead trait\nyeah yeah oh definitely\nwhat are the odds um\nyou said uh someone said meeks\nokay let's look at tom cruise's brother\num tom cruise\nno way\nthat is what that is\ninteresting so tom cruise has had a lot\nof work done to be fair um i don't know\nif you've seen his like teeth uh his uh\ni'm almost certain that tom cruise\nuh possibly had a jaw implant i'm almost\nyeah i think he's hearing that there's a\nlot of speculation but yeah they\ndefinitely have the same jaw um but one\nhas very poor mid facial development and\nthe other has venom in facial\ndevelopment uh also i think tom cruise's\nmoney and uh his role in the public eye\nhas led to that's no no that's his bro\nno no no\nthat's not tom cruise's brother that's\nhis brother look they even have the the\nsame um\nthe same smile yeah the same smile the\nsame jaw everything uh the difference is\nin the mid face and then obviously the\nhairline so i'm guessing tom cruise is\neither heavily on finasteride and um\nwhat's it called uh home uh what okay\ni'm pretty sure yeah\nyeah i'm also pretty sure tom cruise\nsays uh fillers um\ni remember one time seeing him um and he\nlooked very bloated like in like that\nfiller that overfilled kind of like\nthing and that's the thing you know if\nyou guys are trying are even considering\num somebody said that's his cousin not\nhis brother um oh okay let's take let's\nsee if we can find a closer example\napparently oh okay they're cousins um\n[Music]\nand yeah\ngo go ahead\num julie no i feel like he\ni can't find anything on his um\ndoes he not have a brother or\njay to be the brother could be albino\nthe last brother that we just brought up\nyeah\nuh we got andrew andrew says what about\nyour\nwhat about your brother what do you mean\nwhat about do you have a brother coops\nuh\ni do but he's um i think he's probably\ngoing to be more attractive i don't know\num\noh i think we're quite similar like he\nlooks very much like me when i was\nyounger um hopefully i i teach him\nfacial development so he becomes better\nlooking\nrob kardashian is a good example\nyeah all right uh we got uh let me see\nhenata can you compare brothers and\nsisters like this\num yeah there's actually a lot of\nexamples of brothers and sisters we'll\ngo into that after this one so we do rob\nkardashian um who is um who do we\ncompare rob kardashian to there's no\nthere's no analog to rob\nbecause you can't really compare him to\nhis sisters\nit's not because they all had work done\ni you know it's nice i feel like that's\nlike you can't really compare because\nit's just like\nwe're not talking about plastic sir\num oh is it so here's an interesting\nexample so we're looking at um this one\nhere uh his sister george clooney's\nsister ada zeidler so if we just do a\nsearch there\ni think um\nthis is this is this one's quite\ninteresting so aydah zeidler is\nobviously the i'm george clooney and\naydah's idler um his sister uh sorry\nadelia ideally uh\nthey're they're in there like 50s 60s\nnow they're considerably old but um it's\nclear to see that one has aged better\nthan the other and um\nsomeone also said ashton kutcher's\nbrother uh this is\nso this is clooney\ngeorge clooney's sister\ngeorge this is george clooney's sister\nright now right yeah as we said yeah\nokay yeah\ni mean one one is age better than the\nother and\ni mean i think george clooney has aged\nlike fine wine\nyeah i mean look at his uh look at his\nbone structure look at how it developed\nhis jaws the thing about bone structure\nis when you have very strong dental\nfacial growth uh even if the skin and\nthe soft tissue sags away and it\ndisappears\nthe bone structure will still be there\nand that's the essence of what makes a\nhandsome man\ni i think also the thing about it is\nwhen you're talking about um\nyou know um\nsiblings that are not in the spotlight\nyou become less self-conscious about\nyour look\nand and your health\nsometimes by the wayside because usually\nwhen people get older they just get so\ntired and you know you're working your\nwhatever nine-to-five job and so things\nkind of go you know slack because of\nthat your body suffers from uh you know\nfrom you know you not working out you're\nnot exercising and um\nyeah and that's kind of like how you\nstart gaining weight and start losing\nlosing your structure somebody said\ncameron herron's brother we've already\nlooked at that i think that is this one\num so that's cameron herring that's his\nbrother\nthat's pretty it's pretty awe oh this is\nan interesting one kim possible said\nbritney spears and her sister\nokay britney spears we haven't done\nreally any women\nall right let's take a look at britney\nspears system\nyeah um\nyeah no i see this quite similar\nx xl uh jingping i don't i don't think\nwe can do uh your suggestion uh because\ni just i fear\nif he looks up any images we might find\nsomething that we might\nwho's the suggestion yeah\ni think it was riley reed oh no\nyeah yeah we've got a turn safe mode on\nfor that\nyeah\num\nyeah i think they're quite similar uh\nexcept\none\nlooks uh like she's aged a bit worse\nthan the other and um i think to be fair\nbritain\nyeah i mean to be fair like britney gosh\nbritney had has had she's had one hell\nof a life\nyeah i mean yeah\num but if we're gonna just talk about\nwe're not going to say lesser attractive\nlet's look at it\ni think they're very much equal like\nlike honestly they're very much equal\nsame features nothing um the only\nmajorly different examples we found were\num so brad pitt um where was it uh not\nnot rami malik but cameron heron and\nthen also\nuh now demarco i believe uh and tony\nmafford these are the only major\ndifferences we've found so far uh with\nthe brothers\num somebody's is\nthat a uh i'm noticing um\nis that a rhinoplasty from britney\nspears i'm no you know yeah yeah it's\ngot the uh the sunken in\nuh the uh it's called it's like the\npinched nose look yeah yeah the pink\nnose yeah yeah yeah\nyeah 100 yeah that's actually do you\nthink it's a characteristic uh trace so\nthose of you that don't know one of the\nways you can tell a rhinoplasty is that\nonce the doctors remove cartilage from a\nspecific area that region starts to sink\nand it creates this very noticeable um\npinched nose look now noticeable in the\nsense that people who know know and\npeople who don't don't will never know\nuh if you notice that her um a base\ncontour goes straight like a triangle\nand for the pinched nose look it's more\nof a um\nit curls upwards a bit more and the\nnostril is more exposed so\nuh yeah\nyeah her nose she definitely got\nrhinoplasty well done and it's one of\nthe telltale signs\nkevin kevin said mike thurston's brother\noh mike thurston uh he is a bodybuilder\nthat i\nuh i religiously look at for um yeah\ni think he recently got a hair\ntransplant mike dustin\nokay um good good for him\nso so it's he's australian right um\nyeah i think so i'm not too sure i i\ndon't know all that much about him um\nby the way if you guys have any personal\nstories of like\num you like questions\nuh i i don't think there's there's not a\nlot of pictures of of his brother and\nyeah if you guys have um any stories if\nyou have any personal stories of like\nuh a favoritism with like sibling\nfavoritism because of uh looks uh i\nwould love to uh\nread them\nuh\nthe olsen sisters um\n[Music]\nyeah they're so similar looking it's\nit's it's\ncome on yeah you're going to give us\nexamples of where they look completely\ndifferent um\ncatherine langford oh miley cyrus i i\ndid read about this one uh so miley\ncyrus and actually we so everyone knows\nwhat miley cyrus looks but what about\nher brother trace cyrus\ni think miley cyrus's dental facial\ngrowth is interesting uh i will say this\nthis is um yeah\noh this is the old ones okay okay let me\njust double check that i got the right\nguy uh yeah so trace trace cyrus um\nis apparently he just looks so different\nthat i'm not even sure if i have the\nright guy\nwell i feel like the olsen twins i mean\ni mean everyone basically looks the same\nthe only thing is that olsen twins has\nhave had\nso much uh plastic surgery that it's\njust kind of like i feel like it's aged\nthem honestly\nyeah yeah for sure for sure a good\nexample\nanyone have any more suggestions for us\nto look at\ngiselle and sister okay i like that um\nso\nwho's in the chat i i see some familiar\nfaces in the chat uh\nwe got shale casey ace\nuh bob bob again uh jared messer\neric\nuh his sister's very much she's similar\nlooking to her uh\nvery much the same i think maybe there's\nlike a little bit of a high difference\nbut other than that\nvictoria's secret model more or less the\nsame let's see if we can get there was a\ngood example somebody gave us earlier\nsomeone said actually um\nashley simpson and jessica simpson\nuh well the one i want to look at first\nis jeremy meek's brother apparently he\nhas a player\njeremy meeks has a brother that's what i\nheard\noh my god\nthere's like a whole set of family\nphotos that's pretty funny\ni wonder if he got the eyes as well or\nuh yeah this one there you go\nso let me just move it\nthoughts\napparently\ncan anybody confirm this is actually his\nbrother\nthat's\nwhat do you think jc\ni\ni need to see it i haven't seen it can\nyou see it can you\ncan you blow it up i haven't seen it\ni think it is\nyeah i feel like similar features\ninsanely uh he's got a crazy jaw at the\njaw angle is almost 90 degrees and it's\nsuper masculinizing whereas jeremy has\ngot more of those pretty boy features\nhis his angle is more feminine\nbut it's still equally wide and it works\nto their credit but\nthey're both kind of like on more or\nless\nsame playing field yeah no no i think\njeremy easily has got better features\nthat's more appealing to\nthe the larger audience um because it's\ngot a mix of feminine characteristics as\nwell whereas his jaw the brother's jaw\nis super smooth crazy yeah\nbut i i do i do feel like i don't think\nhe's like\nsignificantly lesser\nless attractive oh no no the similar\nthis yeah this one uh\nyeah so the example somebody said is\nashton\nbutchers\noh wait we you forgot jessica simpson\nashley simpson i think that's a because\nwe've done a lot of men okay yeah we'll\ndo this one and then we'll go to jessica\nsimpson\nyeah uh ashton kutch's brother\nhi\nit's that's um\nquite interesting\nwell while you're looking that up we\nhave writing with\ninc i feel like my dad liked my sister\nmore than me when we were younger there\nwere so many factors that\nuh contributed\ni was overweight and like he used to be\nuh oh shoot i just lost it\num\njessica simpsons did you say jessica\nsimpson\noh yeah yeah jessica simpson at and\nashley simpson okay uh the more or less\nquite similar looking\nlet's see if i can find a good photo uh\nwe got another one from abby uh yeah my\nsister often got favorited i am asian\nand my sister is asian and half white\npeople described her as\npretty but they referred to me as the\nsmart one oh you know always that's\ntough\nthat is\nthat is unfair\nthoughts on ashley and jessica simpson\ncan you see it yet\nuh yes i i can't see it it just needed\nto be blown up\num\nand it's crazy how jeremy meeks married\na uh billionaire\nyeah a billionaire heiress and had a\nbaby so he's locked in\nfinancially\nwe'll look at a couple more examples for\nyou guys but overall what is the take\nfrom this what can we say\nwell i think a lot of it has to do with\nlike your lifestyle and your habits and\num\nbut at the same time it's it's like um\ni feel like especially with the\nkardashians\nwhen\none of them when they started getting\nbecause it was like one per i forgot\nwhich kardashian\nwaited the longest before she got\nplastic surgery\nbut i was a close\ni think it might have been chloe yeah so\nchloe waited the longest before she got\nplastic surgery and then you know there\nwas just so much favoritism\nlike from the public yeah\nand uh and eventually i guess she just\ndecided to go to go with it\nand um\nyeah i i think you know there's just a\nlot of like the quality of life it's a\nlittle bit different\nand you either have to fully accept it\nand just know that it might be there uh\nor you can do something about it or\nyou know i mean\nyeah that's the best way i can say that\nlook\nlike i said uh the belief that i i have\nis that 60 genetics 40\nuh upbringing and there are things that\nyou can do which separate brothers good\nlike example here somebody said wolfhard\nwhat do you think it's there's quite a\nbig difference i think in their\naesthetics\none has a significantly weaker midface\nregion so his eyes appear to be uh\ndrooping downwards and this is a\ncharacteristic trait so so\nis that a negative cancel yeah yeah so\nthey're called a negative cancel tilt uh\nthat\nit's one of those characteristic traits\nthat um basically makes the face appear\nlike it's just drooping off and it's it\ndoesn't exactly strike fear into the\nhearts of your enemies so that's one of\nthe reasons why yep\nwhy does his face look like he he has\nfiller uh on the left\nben wolfhard yeah um\nit looks like a little bit of filler\nlike you know that cheap yeah yeah no no\nhe definitely doesn't have filler but uh\nlike\nhe is um\nhis aesthetic is it's like very much\nit's super androgynous to to begin with\nso yeah the fact that his brother is a\nbit more masculine looking with those\nandroid with a lot of those feminine\nandrogynous features it gives him\nnot the best look and i don't want to be\nmean here but\ni think this somewhat like finn is uh\npersonally i don't think finn is like\nsuper handsome or attractive he plays\nhis he plays his roles really well and\nhe's a very good casting for the show\ncan you get a picture of him with his\nface relaxed\ni feel like it's gonna look a little bit\nbetter his eyebrows uh kind of like you\nknow feminize them because he has pretty\nsharp and\nno no the thing is so so he's got very\nfeminine so this is the brother by the\nway so he's got very feminine\ncharacteristics uh but then uh well\nespecially with the long hair that's not\ndoing him any favors uh if that's\naesthetic is going for and then he's got\na super masculine jaw and even then it's\nnot it's not masculine like\nlike a pretty boy masculine it's like a\ndrill sergeant masculine so very very\nlow at jaw angle very sharp corners very\nwide\nand it creates this blocky effect that\ndoesn't contrast with the long hair the\nthe drooping eyes the weak mid face the\nmid face\nwhat's called under eye deformity under\neye contour deformity so so there's many\ncharacteristics of his face that makes\nit look like like it's it's not\nharmonious it's discordant as we would\nsay if\ni feel like if he had a different\nhaircut we might\nlike um i don't know maybe he's just\ndoing what his brother does and you know\nthey're both just rocking the the curly\nhair um because he does have a jawline\nyou know it's not like completely you\nknow you know i mean\nyeah like he's got some things going for\nhim but like that i the eye area is a\nvery big detractor to his attractiveness\nand i think that's probably\nlike the first thing we look at is the\neyes actually so i would actually argue\nthat having attractive eyes might even\nbe more desirable than an attractive jaw\nbecause you can always augment the job\nbut you can't uh change many of the\nfeatures of the eye region\nyeah of course of course uh you know you\nknow what i always notice uh have you\never noticed like when uh men get older\nlike the classic thing that men like to\ndo\nuh because they don't know how to handle\nwith aging uh men older men always start\nwearing sunglasses like you'll search\nmen wearing sunglasses indoors and\nwhatnot\nuh yeah 100 i've noticed that and that's\nbecause they don't know what to do about\nthe drooping eyes um the the face is\njust basically the the soft tissue is\nfalling off and they don't know how to\nhandle that they think that you know\ncosmetic surgery or non-surgical yeah\nthey would rather wear sunglasses\nexactly like that that's a very good\nobservation uh we'll just do a couple\nmore women um so beyonce and salangay\nwait wait is that a is that who i think\nit is is that uh vinnie bennett yeah\nvinnie\ni couldn't find any convincing photos of\nhis brother so\num if i'm not mistaken i could have\nsworn vinnie had a negative canceled so\nbut that might have been his makeup\nbecause the way\nbecause he sometimes like wears i think\nit's closer to neutral it's just the uh\nthe way the the camera was taken\num and he always likes kind of like\nputting his chin upwards so he's kind of\nlike always yeah yeah yeah yeah 100\nso it just looks like that so ksi and\nactually let's just i want to do more\nwomen uh comparisons uh so bridgette\nbardo\nbridget\nand min\nuh kim wong uh does cheerleader affect\nhelp or hurt\num in the kevin jonas example\nuh that is a good example so if we\nactually go back to it that is i\ndefinitely think it helps so there's the\nfranco's\nit definitely helps the cheerleader\neffect\nthe way we covered it in our video was\nthat this psychological implication\nmeans that when you look at the brothers\naltogether you're observing them all\nholistically you're looking at three\ndudes staring at you rather than each\nindividual facial characteristic by\nitself so you know this one has a more\ndefined jaw this one has a more rounded\njaw this one has a more uh sharper jaw\ni'm not noticing those things when i'm\nlooking at them i'm just looking at why\nare these three dudes staring at me you\nknow so that's that's not my first\nthought and that's how the cheerleader\neffect basically works\ncasey neistat is the king of the droop\nhis excuse for wearing sunglasses is\nthat he looks at the preview screen on\nhis camera when he's vlogging\nyeah i mean\ni don't i don't even want to show it\nbecause it's like we all know like casey\nneistat has a very droopy eye area and\num he's\nobviously very insecure about it it's\nsomething that bothers him so you know i\ndon't know who that is\nokay\nfine i guess we have to yes we have to\nno i mean you don't you don't have to\nbring it up if he if he's really\nself-conscious about it i feel like\nno let's go to someone else\num we'll do one more\none more woman zayn malik and his\nsisters um uh by the way jordan uh\nmafumbo uh i know you say chloe and\nhaley uh bailey i feel like they're more\nor less the same i mean i just feel like\nthe only difference is like very similar\ni think yeah i think the only difference\nis\nlike style wise like one is a little bit\nmore uptight and the other one wants to\nbe kind of like\nfreer and you know\nyou know that's personality wise you can\ntell in the hair style\ndo i leave a\nsister does the door leaper have a\nsister\ni didn't know doolie but had a sister\nthese are very interesting comments from\nyou guys uh i love reading them um okay\nshe does have a sister huh\nlook at that\ncome on mary says whenever i see\nextended family and friends everyone\ngreets my sister with you're so pretty\nand i get you've gotten taller oh no no\nthat's that's some oh man amalia and\nsasha are bomb with that okay i think\nthis there's a case to be made there\num\ni think there's a case to make this so\ndua lipa does have a sister um\ni think dua lipa got the better end of\nthe stick she is taller uh she does have\nbetter facial features her sister's not\nparticularly um unattractive\nthat's a i believe that's a sister\nshe's she's a singer um\nyeah yeah i mean but she's covering up\nthe eyes i can't oh yeah yeah yeah so\nnot the best example but uh yeah this\none is i think it's pretty clear dual\nepo got the better on the stick and\nshe's in um\nokay let's see if we can find\nexamples of malia and sasha um\ni was saying that i was overweight and\nreminded him of a younger version of\nhimself in a bad way my sister did too\nbut in a better attractive way writing\nwith inc\noh geez\nyeah that's that that's the one i mean\nthat yeah\nyeah\num so thoughts on uh malia and sasha\nuh i don't see the picture up i only see\nyeah it's not up here it's\nwell now now you just changed it to that\nyeah cool you got to blow it up so i can\nsee\nyeah so\num\nlet's do it not a profile let's not oh\nokay not a profile\nyeah okay\nuh in the comments people are saying\nlindsay lohan and her brother\num malia and sasha obama hike okay fine\nmalia\nuh\nuh monty daley says being\nafro-indigenous my family uh\nhas a range of variety of afro\nuh\nlight skin and dark skin was an\nunfortunate thing of uh favoritism well\nthat's colorism um\nwell that's a whole different\nyeah that's a\nthat's i mean does affect definitely\nlike skin color is also part of um your\nidentity and so\nyou can't you can't ignore how that ties\ninto perceptions of beauty or how people\nmight look at you but um that though\nwell what we're focusing on is like uh\nyou know\nweaker features things like that that\nmight detect more more special features\nthings that yeah uh more dental facial\nstructural that kind of thing uh so this\nis\nyeah this will be the last example we'll\nbe looking at uh just let me know when\nyou can see it jc\ni can see it but can you make it a\nlittle bit bigger\ni'm noticing her top third uh whoever\nthat is on the right uh she has a very\nlarge forehead\nyeah um\ni i think that's the older one is malia\ncan somebody confirm\ndo you know anyone down uh\nwhich ones i always forget um\nremember the name\ni know the older one um\nshe's i think yeah like again she's\ntaller she's got she's got better growth\nbetter facial development\num but i do notice she does have a bit\nof a um\nlook at her jaw angle it's insanely\ndivergent\num so\ni what it points to is some kind of\nmaxillary um what's it called overbite\nor uh yeah\nthere's a word for it by maxillary\nprotrusion uh and which is i feel like\nmichelle if i'm not mistaken i feel like\nmichelle's\ndental facial features had something no\nno but i'm not no no no i think\nmichelle's facial features are perfectly\nfine like there's no weird um\ndental facial issues but maxillary dento\nwhat's it called i keep forgetting the\nname um\nthen\nno\nocclusion so you're talking about no no\nnot malicious uh it has a specific name\num\ndental alveolar protrusion or\naxillary dental overbite those are\nexamples of what's known as uh\nprognathic\njaw injuries or jaw malfunctions right\nand story thank you so much soria\nsomeone said\num yeah pragmatism yeah um but the thing\nis\npragmatism is more like an overbite and\nan underbite um maxillary protrusions\nare slightly different in that the upper\njaw um\nlike you can see she has i think it's\nvery clear here that she has an\nunderbite going on and you can see how\nshe like pouts that lower lip uh in\nfront of the other yeah\nthe the younger sister doesn't have that\nactually um i don't know she's she has\nher mouth open but uh just from the jaw\nalone you can tell that she doesn't have\nthat whereas the older one does and\nthat's one of the key signs is how long\nthe\njoys the mandible is and how uh obtuse\nthe joy angle is so basically the door\nis like stretching out and uh it affects\ni think it affects the african-american\npopulation more than any other racial\ngroup yeah\nand it's like ten percent of the\npopulation has it which is insane uh\nit's insanely high but uh we made a\nvideo on that\num\nwell we can wrap this one up because we\ncan probably have to go over the uh tick\ntock right now yep so well that that's\nit for this week uh thank you to\neveryone for joining we we looked at a\nlot of different faces yep thank you uh\nguys uh delirious casey nathan sandhu\nuh jasmine team we got zayn uh don\nuh everyone else who's been in the\ncomments section uh helping us with

[Bite-Sized]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "okay but that's not the same that's not\nthe same thing\nyeah well\nit's kind of not exactly the same even\nthough functionally both are examples of\nwhat we would call androgenic alopecia\nnow androgenic alopecia is the most\ncommon type of hair loss and this is a\nhormonal based hair loss so male pattern\nbaldness or female pattern baldness as\nchris rock unfortunately found out the\nhard way but the reason why i say that\nthey're not the same aesthetically\nspeaking is because the incidences of\nwomen losing their hair is far far lower\nthan men losing their hair so even\nthough they're the same technically the\nsocial implications of losing your hair\nas a woman is far worse and there's a\nnumber of reasons for this mainly the\nquickest answer i can give in a tick\ntock video is that men put a great\nemphasis on a woman's attractiveness\nphysical attractiveness as the\ndeterminant for if they are a desirable\npartner or not whereas women look at a\nnumber of things for a man like looks\nmoney and status also personality\nambition and drive but those are\nsecondary characteristics in all cases\nwhere we've compared men to women in\nterms of hair loss the results have been\nthat it's far more distressing for women\nbecause it's not something that you\nwould expect whereas for men it is\nexpected because the large majority of\nmen almost two-thirds experience male\npattern baldness at some point in their\nlife whereas it's less than 10 for women\nbecause it's rarer when you do see it\nyou expect it to be some form of\nsystemic illness which is why it's taken\nmuch more seriously"}]}

"content": "hello and welcome to our q a so\nthis is the first time that we're\nactually doing a q a on the channel and\ni'm joined today with jason the catalyst\nand together we've been doing a lot of\ncontent on\nthe podcast uh the glow up podcast\nespecially so if you guys aren't\nfamiliar with jc he makes a lot of\ncontent on tick tock he's very good at\nwhat he does\nbut yeah well the reason why we have\nthis is to really talk to the audience\nabout some of the aesthetic questions\nthat you guys have and i know there's a\nlot but we can't always answer them in a\n20-minute video you know so this is a\ngood way to really start talking about\nthings um so\nlet's uh\njc\nwell uh i i see a couple people coming\nin uh we i see victor cactus\nuh hello this is different very cool\ndangerous thanks for sending my report\nlet's\nuh\nyeah nicole only sometimes feel better i\nhope you feel better one hey uh\ndemetrius brown thanks for sending my\nreport cactus hello oh he's got a\nverified tick i wonder what he makes\nwhat kind of content does cactus make\nwhy does height matter by orangey\nthat's a good question let's start with\nthat\nwell uh i would say probably it's a\ndominating feature i mean first of all i\ni would say i mean\nmost if we're talking about males\nmales aren't supposed to be taller and\nso it's a sign dominance uh that would\nbe one aspect of it\num i i know that with a couple of\nstudies\nwomen who are taller than a male feel a\nlittle bit more uh\nuh\nuh masculine uh masculinized um yeah\nyeah so yeah i mean it's a sexually\ndimorphic characteristic i think there\nwas there's a study and i'm going off\nthe top of my head the ideal male to\nfemale um\npairing for like a\nfor a healthy relationship i don't know\ni wouldn't say it's a healthy but most\nwomen prefer men that are uh six inches\nor five inches taller than they are so i\nknow that that's that's quite a big ask\nbut when you consider that you know the\naverage is like the average woman is\nlike five five or something it's it's\nquite understandable why most women look\nat the 510 range or you know the six\nfoot range so desirably\ni would say the big biggest thing if\nyou're worried about height and let's\nsay you're five eight or five nine or\nsomething like that\ni would definitely not do any uh\nlengthening uh leg lengthening surgery\nyeah it's a lot of complications with\nthat so i i would say at the very least\nuh you can just get lifts it's like 10\nbucks you can get on amazon i mean yeah\nthat's that's uh with that uh i would\nsay if you're going to go with the lift\nroute uh don't don't get the 10 buck 10\nbucks ones on amazon actually go and get\nlike custom shoes that um are made for\nlike the the lifts i remember those\nthere was a company that actually\nsponsored us a long time ago uh it's\ncalled guido maggie and uh they make\nlike the they're like the designers\nthey're like the designer shoes\nequivalent of uh shoes of lifts right\nand they make these really\nnicely done shoes that have like you\nknow like three four inches of heel and\nit's like super super\num it's hidden it's you can't tell at\nall and they're very very high quality\nthey're expensive obviously they're like\nuh they're like twelve hundred dollars\nusd i think at the time who has twelve\nhundred dollars in this economy yeah i\nmean\nthat's the thing that's the thing like\nit's like it's like if you're going to\ndo it do it right um otherwise it may\njust backfire on you so um if you can\nafford it you know there's really good\noptions out there and i still have the\npair that they sent me i don't really\nneed it but i'm not gonna lie having the\nthe boost is is very nice so\nthere's that i i\ni do i do believe in definitely\ninvesting in quality long term i just\ni just know\nfrom a standpoint um if you don't have\nthe money then\nuh you can do the lips uh just because i\nknow a lot of people have different\ntypes of shoes that they want you know\nsome people like jordan some people like\nthis type of shoe yeah\nand then if you go with like one company\nyou're kind of locked in with that uh\ngranted uh i'm sure they probably\nunderstand how to properly you know\nmake it fit and make it look kind of\nseamless so i definitely that that's a\ngood option i just know that a lot of\npeople don't have um\nyou know the finances uh for a twelve\nhundred dollar yeah kind of uh yeah i\nmean that's fair i mean\nyou know it's it's one of those things\nit's like if you can you should but if\nyou can't then yeah\nthat's the best and and with limb\nlengthening that's something um i'm\nactually quite knowledgeable about this\nbecause uh it's very to me it's such a\nfascinating concept the idea of\ncutting your bones and then expanding it\num and and with limb lengthening i would\nsay that it's it's arguably the most\ndangerous operation there is in the\nworld i think it has like a six percent\nmortality rate sorry not six it's\nactually more like five percent but um\nthat's that's really high when you think\nabout it and granted that that's still\nyou know low enough to be\ndoable in a lot of parts of the world\nand limb lengthening can be done in\nplaces like uh the us as big doctors\nlike dr paley they basically wrote the\nbook on the surgery but it's super\nexpensive\nand i think\nyou can't yeah you can't really do the\ngym uh intensely like you used to yeah\nthere's gonna be a down time of like\nsix to one year just fully off the gym\nand it's like a very slow recovery back\nit's basically you're learning how to\nwalk again like after an uh after a car\ncrash or something and for that you know\nit's just i just think it's um unless\nyou're very very short like well let's\nsay five four and under\nit's really not the best option i think\neven like lifts or something might just\nbe better for for in that case you know\nyeah i i think the only time where it\nbecomes a situation is i i've seen uh\npeople that uh have\ndwarfism um\ndo it and then i i partially understand\nthat so it's just like that that's\nsomething where um the surgery might be\nuh an option to look into yeah all right\nlet's uh let's go through some comments\nso firstly uh some\nuh serious greek uh series geek asked no\nsuper chat no we're not doing a super\nchat just because it's the first one i\nalso don't want you guys spending money\non this it's there's no reason to um\nthere's dylan asking are you hiring at\nthe moment we do have some open\npositions you can view that on the\nwebsite um\nlena lena\nuh lena linda\nwhat are your thoughts on mewing this is\nsomething we get asked so much and i\nknow i haven't made a video on mewing\nexplicitly but it's just it's a very\ndifficult topic to address\nyeah um i mean knewing is just proper\ntongue posture when it comes down to it\nit's gonna make your jaw look chiseled\nand amazing uh no uh it's it's not gonna\njust do that but it's gonna make sure\nthat you have the best possibility for\nyour facial growth\nto um to grow where how it's supposed to\nbe versus if you were to do mouth\nbreathing which your face will grow uh\ndownward so and it's really i mean\nit's extremely important to have proper\ntongue posture during the uh growing\nyears of your life\nyeah and i think tongue posture is\nreally the name of the game ewing itself\nis is the process of trying to it's it's\na set of exercises rather than like just\na methodology itself um but having\nproper tongue posture it's kind of like\nwith posture you're not actively\nexercising your posture every day you\njust have it or you don't you know you\njust stand up straight and sit with nice\nposture or you don't and so mewing is\nvery much the same thing you rest your\ntongue on the roof of the upper palate\nand uh you just do that just becomes a\nhabit you don't really need to actively\ndo these\njaw exercises and these\nthese tongue exercises that i see\npractice so much because that in itself\nthat should have been a habit with all\nof your healthy eating diets and you\nknow your your boldest chewing and\nthere's so many other smaller things\nthat you should have been practicing\nrather than trying to do a 10 minute\nexercise every day that's my take on\nviewing it's not yeah because your\ntongue should be resting i mean 24 7 on\nthe roof of your mouth and you doing 10\nminutes is kind of like a drop in the\nbucket exactly exactly over like a\nlifetime of uh not doing the right thing\nand uh if you guys some people\nmewing will never help them because uh\nyou're either you're it's too old you\nknow after adolescence your face is more\nor less just sutured\nsutured shut uh because the sutures that\nuh control the different\nfacial bones uh they just fuse they\ndon't fuse together but they're it's\nmuch harder to move them right so\nduring adolescence when your face really\nstarts to expand that's the best time\nbut after that there isn't much you can\ndo and if you're missing a jaw like you\nhave a very recessed jaw\ntrust me you need to go see an\northodontist you need to get implants\nyou need to get double jaw surgery\nbecause mewing and all of these\nsubliminals and you just useless youtube\nlike life hacks that people give it it\nwill not help it will not help you need\nto go see a black and white science yeah\nbasically it's the equivalent of science\nj y o t\ns n a pandu says i love the podcast so\nhe likes a lot of your podcasts okay\nyeah yeah i think uh\npandu he also asked how do you fix\nasymmetry uh i'll go first so\nthat's that's a more difficult question\nthere's many different types of\nasymmetry if you saw a video on a\nsymmetry there's two types of asymmetry\nthere's directional asymmetry and\nfunctional asymmetry and so\num\nwhen it comes to asymmetry it depends is\nit like is it a dental facial issue like\nis your jaw asymmetric on one side in\nwhich case you know no amount of like\nsubliminals and the mewing exercise is\ngoing to fix that you need to go\nagain see i see a doctor you see an\northodontist but is it is it something\nlike uh do you have a lump on one side\nof the face that you don't have in the\nother is your cheekbone flatter on one\nside of the face sitting down on the\nother those things can be fixed by\ndermal fillers and implants so there's\nthere's different options depending on\nthe type of asymmetry and they they're\nnot all built equally some asymmetries\nlike say having a mole on one side of\nyour face and not on the other that's\nvery benign that's not that's that's not\nserious at all compared to hey having a\nmessed up jaw that's completely rotated\nincorrectly\nand and the thing about it is what is\nyour lifestyle habits what are you doing\nthat could possibly cause asymmetries\nare you doing anything that that could\ncause that problem because sometimes\nyeah we can become born with uh certain\nfacial asymmetries but like if you're\ndoing certain bad habits then you need\nto correct that first before you're\ntrying to uh essentially correct\nanything any damage that has been done\nyeah no i i think that's that's pretty\nmuch it like with asymmetry there isn't\na whole lot you can do depending on the\ntype of recipe and this is why it's so\nimportant this is why the coupes report\nthis is why all of these\nresources we've put out there on the on\nthe website to help you guys understand\nthat it's very important to assess the\nface correctly before you can even find\nsolutions because one solution that's\nmade for joy symmetry is not the same as\nwhat's what you do for say uh mid-face\nasymmetry they're completely different\nsolutions uh so assessment's very\nimportant\num moving on\ni i would say uh last last thing with um\nwith that asymmetry i would say sleep on\nyour back do not sleep on your side\ndefinitely or your stomach that's like\nthe worst thing that you can do if you\nwant asymmetries go at by all means\nsleep on your thigh but i would\ndefinitely get a firm pillow i actually\ngot a nice pillow that kind of like kind\nof muscles my head and help me uh stay\nthat's actually yeah that's def that's a\nvery big point um sleeping on your back\nwe made the video on this uh it's one of\nthe big factors for asymmetries and it\nbasically pushes your entire face uh to\none side if you start sleeping on your\nside so try practicing sleeping on your\nback it's our ancestors slept it's a\nproper way of sleeping uh and you get a\npillow like jc's saying with the with\nthe cradle to like stop you from moving\naround it is habit it's not it's not\nimpossible to do you're just comfortable\nin sleeping on your side because that's\nwhat you used to it's a habit i i used\nto sleep on my side i changed after i\nfound out and uh yeah i'm always\nsleeping on my back now\nby the way if you guys have any um\nany questions that we have not read yet\njust uh repeat the questions in the\ncomments so that we can uh we'll be able\nto see them if we tag\nstudio so it gets highlighted um let's\ngo through some more so motionless\npuppet why do women rate average men\nbelow average there's always\ndiscrepancies when men are rated um i'll\ntake this one so we covered this on the\ndeep dive podcast so that's our other\npodcast and uh on that one we basically\nfound that\nwhen it comes to women's preferences\nthey have a hard threshold so they have\na requirement and men they have more of\na preference and men are willing to go\nbelow their preference uh if the if the\nwomen show\nother kind of characteristics that they\nfind desirable like motherly\ncharacteristics or nurturing\ncharacteristics whereas with women since\nthey're going to be carrying their child\nfor you know the next nine months or so\nthey're not really going to sacrifice on\na subpar man and uh that could mean\neverything from ambition drive physical\nattractiveness everything you know the\nman really has to be the whole package\nwhich is why uh men\nare rated much more unfairly i wouldn't\nsound fairly i think it's quite fair how\nwomen rate men but they're rated much\nmore strictly than men rate women\nwell i would i i personally would beg\nthe difference and this is partially due\nto how\ndating apps and social media in general\nhas kind of like made both genders kind\nof\nhint of delusional um\nwith um the amount of options that we\nhave and so uh we kind of talked about\nthis on the podcast before but\nhaving a over abundance of options or\ntheoretical options that you might have\ngives this kind of like um oh i can find\nsomeone better\nand i mean it's overstimulating\nyeah it's overstimulating and a lot of\ntimes people don't want to commit\nanymore because there's always\nsomething better on the horizons and and\ni think the same could also be said for\nmen it's just that men have it worse\nbecause it's harder for them it's harder\nfor the average man to uh you know find\na partner because uh just because of how\nthis idea of the\nthreshold you know a hard threshold\nversus a soft threshold it's easier for\nwomen to\nfind a partner because they know that if\nthey show the right characteristics\nqualities men will go below their\npreferences and for the other way around\nit you know there's no compromising\nthere so it's harder for the average\nperson but easier for the average woman\nhard for the average man easy for the\naverage woman\ndr romance says does hair dye affect\nattractiveness and\ndoes color matter so i'm going to let\nyou answer that one\num hair dye i think\nin one study this is so far this is so\nlong ago i think off the top of my head\nthere were certain hair colors that were\nseen as more\nthey had different perceptions so like\nbrunettes were seen as like more serious\nblondes were seen as more fun um but in\nterms of men um speaking for from the\nmales out there uh darker hair does make\nyou seem more virile you know healthy uh\npotent\nyouthful so hair dye in terms of you\nknow dark if your if your hair's\ngray you might want to get that darkened\nthat does help but actually the actual\ncolor itself doesn't really matter other\nthan say blondes so men who are blonde\nand have like blonde eyebrows uh that\nthat is a hit to your attractiveness\nif we're not considering the the whole\nwhite uh eurocentrism aspect of it that\nhaving blonder features is a hit to\nattractiveness because it\nyou can't really tell where the face\nstarts and ends anymore it starts to\nblend together whereas a man with very\ndark thick eyebrows and you know i'm\nsure you've seen this like those pretty\nboys on tick tock with very thick dark\neyebrows uh they're seen as much more\nattractive than the equivalent blonde\nversion because it's it's a sign of\nvirility and youthfulness so it makes\nthem seem strong\nlet's uh let's keep going to the\nquestions uh oh we got one from victor\num again uh are joel fillers\na good long term for men\nuh do you wanna take this one\nyeah sure um well here's the thing uh\nfiller uh eventually uh dissolves and\ngets reabsorbed um\ninto your body and so the thing about it\nis filler is a temporary solution and\neventually over time becomes expensive\nif you and this should be the last\nresort i always say this even though\ni've had you guys don't know me i had\njaw surgery i had a genioplasty and i\nhad a rhinoplasty which that means\nrhinoplasty's nose genoplasty your chin\nand i had an underbite and i got that uh\nfixed so\nuh surgery should be the last thing or\nany type of cosmetics uh should be the\nlast thing you do but if you're done\ngrowing if you're absolutely done\ngrowing um then filler is an option\nbut i'm going to get a jaw implant\nactually and i think jaw implants is\nactually an alternative option if you\nhave a very specific\num kind of jawline that you want that\ncan complement your face if you want\nlong term but um filler if you only want\njust a little bit of popping then filler\ncan help but\nyou should know that if you're lean\nuh\nif you're\nnot lean and you're trying to get a\njawline you should first lean out and\nthen evaluate your jawline from there\nbefore you even consider any of these\noptions\ni think that um with like you were\nsaying with the jawline it's better to\nget an implant just because the jaw is\nsuch a functional area and\nthe discrepancies between a strong\njawline and a weak jawline it's a big\ndifference whereas you know say\na sharp cheekbone versus a not sharp\ncheekbone you don't really need an\nimplant for that just a little bit of\ndermal filler is enough to make your\ncheekbones pop but you can't say the\nsame for the jaw so the jaw usually the\nrecommendation is good to go with the\nimplants just because the people that\ncome in need implants\nnot only that yeah but the cheek\nimplants i think they're horrendous\nhonestly exactly so again assessment\nproper assessment is crucial you got to\nknow what the issues are where you're\nstanding and then uh base your solutions\naround that uh larita hadid kuv studio\ndoes face yoga benefit our face in any\nway uh we were actually gonna make a\nface yoga uh like a guide on that but it\nit is useful it is it does help in uh\nfirming the muscles in just like with\nany muscle it does help in uh toning\nthem and helping them um be more robust\nbut\nthe benefits like it's just one of those\nthings i me personally i don't see the\nbenefit in it because it's like i got to\nadd this new thing to my routine and i\ngot to do this and i got to do that you\nknow 30 minutes a day or for what you\nknow like just\nwearing sunscreen is enough to stop the\nbreakdown of collagen and help me look\nmore youthful for longer compared to not\nwearing sunscreen and doing facial yoga\nto you know offset that so there's\nbetter things that you could be doing\ni think face you yoga helps increase\ncirculation in the face um yeah there\nare\nthere are minimal studies that does show\nthat it reduces uh i think two to three\nyears off of your face um they did a\nstudy on i believe people from 30 to\n45 or something like that i forgot what\nage but they were in the older age\ncategory and uh there was\num actual improvement yeah and that's\nkind of works but it's not the best\noption basically\nyeah next question dreams uh any way to\nmake eyebrows closer to eyes for hunter\neye look\nuh so you want to make the eyebrows\nclose oh so you okay so i'm guessing you\nhave like more rounded eyes and you want\nto make your eyes look further down\nand and you want to get a sharper eye\nregion what do you think about this jc\num\ni mean there's first of all there's no\nsurgery necessarily to get what you're\nwhat you're probably thinking of which\nare hunter eyes there's stuff that you\ncan do for almond eye surgery\num\nthere's that but there's not necessarily\na way to get under eyes but however\nthere are certain things that you can do\nto reduce um\nupper eyelid exposure that some people\ndon't really uh consider uh here's the\nthing a lot of us are getting\nfirst of all a lot of us are getting\nsignificantly amount of less sleep so um\nso one of the big things is making sure\nlike you're getting enough sleep and\nthat can cause a lot of and i'm only\nfocusing on upper eyelid exposure right\nnow um\nthat can reduce that and then not only\nthat your head positioning can actually\nreduce upper eyelid exposure because\nthat's one thing i noticed if you have\nproper head posture\nit actually reduces it a lot more but\nthese are kind of superficial kind of\nlike\nways to like get rid of\ni mean i would i don't entirely agree\nwith that because with the hunter eye\nlook i think it's much more based on\nmorphology so it's based on bone\nstructure and you can either have it or\nyou can't there is really realistically\nno\nsafe way of changing the uh the eye\nopening the infra orbital opening what\nwould rather happen is that\nyou can make the eyebrows a bit lower\nyou can make them a bit sharper you can\nangle them you can even make the canthus\nso the eye corners\nfurther apart so you get more of a fox\neye look but they will never be the same\nas the hunter eye look and we explained\nthis in a video on sirenize where\nthere's a concept of the bedroom eyes\nand then there's the concept of the\nsiren eyes the sirenize is something\nthat you can do just by moving your eye\naround and like squinting a little but\nthe bedroom eyes is an it's an actual\neye shape it's like a it's like a facial\nfeature you know it's like\ndefined cheekbones versus not defined\nyou either have it or you don't\nwell i do understand that i did i did\nsay that um in other videos before but\nwhat i was just referencing because i\njust noticed a lot of people when they\nstart asking me about under eyes they\nstart talking about the upper eyelid\nexposure yeah and so that's the only\nreason why i was addressing that i\nwasn't saying that oh you do this you'll\nget hunter eyes that wasn't my whole\nsituation i was just addressing that um\na lot of times people are wanting\ncertain types of eyes\nand there's like little ways that you\ncan definitely improve them to make them\nlook a little bit better and yeah yeah i\nthink uh upper eyelid exposure is\nprobably the biggest one that separates\nrounded eyes from more rectangular eyes\nmasculinized now um this is a good\nquestion what are your thoughts on\naesthetic labor when it pertains to\ndating for people of color\nso aesthetic label for the audience is\nyou know basically changing the way you\nlook to\nfit a certain stereotype\nuh that's the tricky one\nwell um we looked at this very long ago\nand\nmaybe not for dating but what we found\nis that certain types of uh women in the\nmodelling industry so black women\nsouth asian women and east asian women\nhave to significantly change the way\nthey look to fit a certain modeling\ncriteria and i i think we can extend\nthis to\ndating as well that\nyou like a good example of this i saw\nthis on tik tok not too long ago uh how\nthis south asian woman was really\nhating on her\nyounger self for\nbasically she looked like a child back\nthen but she had really dark skin\num she wore glasses it was it wasn't a\ngood look she wasn't exactly she didn't\nexactly have a glow up back then and she\nwas really hairy and you know all these\nthings there might just be natural\nfeatures of your body but\nshe had to change all of them to be\naccepted now as you know very physically\nattractive and and she's like\ncelebrating that now because she changed\nall these things about herself but then\nthat really begs the question of how\nmuch you have to change because of who\nyou are to fit a certain beauty criteria\nwell\ni i heard a story i'm going to tell you\nthis um\nand i stopped\nfully judging this i think this is\nfirst of all i'm going to preface this\ndisclaimer of what i'm about to say\nthis is a situation that happens in\nafrica\nand um\nand i don't think skin bleaching is good\nat all i think it's very terrible but i\nhad to hear\na african woman\nsay dark skinned african woman say that\nshe virtually could not find any work\nbecause the discrimination in africa is\nso horrendous to the point where she has\nto feed her children\nand no one will hire and the only thing\nonly jobs and opportunities\nthat are\navailable in abundance is um\nuh things that are are nightly\nentertainment kind of things yeah and so\num and that's just in certain parts of\nafrica there's not all of africa but\njust in certain countries and it's\nbecause of its own color\nyeah and because of her skin color and\nso what some women do because they want\nto be able to feed their kids and and\nwhatnot they uh they do skin bleaching\nand it does get them better job\nopportunities yeah this is not i think\nit was a very famous documentary from\nvice a couple of years ago where the\nbiggest markets for skin bleaching was\nactually in africa and india which is\nnot what you'd expect it because um you\nwould expect those homogenous societies\nto accept their own skin color as the\nmost acceptive if you're going by you\nknow the familiarity thesis then\nbut for some reason they they want to be\neverything that they're not so\nthere is definitely a heavy bias on\neurocentrism in you know standards of\nbeauty that's that's undeniable but we\ntry to address that as best as we can in\nour discussions on beauty\num moving on some good questions that's\nall so from your experience right so\nthis is by leonard alcacer from your\nexperience just how much can surgical\nintervention really change for\nsimplicity say can an average person go\nto model t can a below average person go\nto model\nwhat do you think jc\nuh i\nuh can i go from like a three to a eight\njust by surgical intervention\nwell i i don't know about a three but um\nbut it depends on what the situation is\ni mean is it a um first of all is the\nreason why you look below average is\nit's because of weight situation is it\nbecause of lack of forward facial growth\nwhat is the situation and yeah\nabsolutely can take you and make you\nlook absolutely amazing i've seen people\nif you ever seen extreme cases of jaw\nsurgery it's like a night and day kind\nof like experience i knew one guy\nhe uh i met him\nand he had a 15 millimeter change in his\nuh open uh he had a overbite and a 15\nmillimeter change is so dramatic you\nwill be it's not recognizable uh you're\nnot the same person\num and so uh just to give you an idea i\nhad an underbite and mine was only two\nmillimeters and changing and so um\nyeah it can it can do a lot of things\nbut i think the big thing that you need\nto understand is you have to if you're\nto get it done get it done by the right\nperson and you have to be very educated\nwith not over doing something and\nunrealistic doing it doing something and\ntrying to expect unrealistic standards\nyou're not going to look exactly like\nbrad pitt or anything like that because\nthat is where you get into trouble\nwaters uh just because you're trying to\nlook like someone else that you're not\nthere's a limit to how much uh surgical\nintervention can get you and i think\nthat's the basic gist of this so with\nthe cases of like extreme jaw\nmalformation extreme jaw deformities\nyou're never going to reach the model t\nlook that's that's just how it is i mean\nthat's that's a brutal reality our\nmedicine is not that good it's very good\nbut it's not that good and so you know\nsay you're going from like a three\nbecause you have some kind of severe jaw\ndeformity or malformity uh you can maybe\nget to like average like the average\nlooking person but beyond that what more\ncan you do realistically uh say you have\na recessed mid face your midface is like\nsunk it in or you have cleft palate\nwhich is a very common condition in\nyoung children\nyou can correct that but if you've seen\nthe before and afters you can't keep\nadding filler and you know implants to\nsculpt the model face\nthe model faces really come from having\na strong foundation of dental facial\ngrowth you know healthy bone structure\nand then you can enhance that by being\nleaned you can you can get some models\nto get surgical intervention to really\nmake the features pop and you look\nunique but you need to be you know say a\nfive six or seven to really get to a\nnine ten\nand so you can't make big jumps to a\nsurgical intervention so to answer this\nquestion\nuh by the way uh\ni will answer a couple of other\nquestions uh but i'll just uh nick loves\nuh coup studio can you suggest uh some\nsimple\nunknown tricks uh and routines that\neveryone should do to improve their\nfacial structure\nwell we actually have a podcast that's\nthat's for a lot of those different\nbreakdowns so\nuh if you want to go in full detail we\nactually have like different things on\nthe jawline uh hairline and things like\nthat yeah the link is in the description\nthe glow up podcast we made that\nspecifically to give you actual advice\non different facial things but i'll tell\nyou one here my favorite thing collagen\nsupplements research has shown that\ntaking collagen supplements daily for\nlike a year or so does improve your\nbody's collagen levels and you can keep\nit in at that high level just by\ncontinuing that habit for as long as you\nlive\nand wearing sunscreen two big things\nthat people don't really consider uh the\nonly reason\ni take collagen supplements personally\nis because i don't get enough from my\nfood like noodles or like bone broth\nthat kind of thing but east asian diets\nhave are very high in collagen and\nthat's one of the reasons why they stay\nyouthful for so long\nbut also sunscreen is very important\nafrican people darker skinned they also\nyou know black don't crack because they\nhave high levels of melanin and so\ntheir melanin kind of acts like an spf\n15 that's what the research said off the\ntop of my head so those are two big\nthings if you're not doing them you\nreally really need to they're like\nrequirements\nand uh antonio arteta uh hey antonio uh\nbone smashing is it legit that's what is\nuh antonio's question i think you can\ntake this one you have very strong\nopinions on bone smashing\noh\nit's absolute garbage uh that's it's\nit's not how bones function and you can\nactually make yourself even more i know\nsome men uh try to do that to widen it\nbut\nyeah your bones don't really work like\nthat you can actually injure and damage\nuh yeah it's it's just it's got to be\nthe dumbest thing it's it's it's it's in\nthis um category of diy uh look lookism\nlooks max looks maxing techniques and\nit's just it's unfounded it's it's the\nexample of people feeling good about\nthemselves because they're doing\nsomething uh even if it's you know not\nhelpful they feel like they're doing\nsomething and they're making progress\nwhen in reality you're going the\ncompletely wrong direction bone smashing\ndoes not work and i don't care what\nanecdotal evidence you have on your\nforums or wherever you're looking it\njust does not work and there is so much\nresearch we can give you on in that if\nyou want to if you want a full episode\non that we can make a glow glower\npodcast episode but it does not work\nplease don't\nwilfred uh\nuh i'm i'm not sure if i'm pronouncing\nthis name right i'm gonna spell k-a-s-e\nwilfred\nare strong jawline's heritable is it\nthat one yeah yep um yes they they are\nheritable uh i would say that if this is\nthis is my guess purely my guess based\non everything we've seen um i would say\nit's 60 genetics 40\nuh certain 60 nature 40 nurture so your\nupbringing how you raise your tongue\nposition your diet all those things but\n60 genetics so it's definitely heritable\nthere's definitely a aspect of\nheritability uh caitlin k coup studio\ndid you guys have any plastic surgery do\nyou have surgery uh i think you just\nsaid you did yeah jc yeah yeah uh for\nthe people that just tuned in i actually\nuh had an underbite i was a skinny kid\num and then at some point i just got\ntired of getting rejected that's kind of\nwhy i made my channel uh just because um\ni started working out every day and then\ni got my jaw surgery which was my\nunderbite fix i had invisalign to\nstraighten my teeth and then they gave\nme a chin by using the genoplasty where\nthey broke my bone of my chin moved it\nforward 10 millimeters and then i had a\nrhinoplasty i didn't necessarily dislike\nmy nose\nit's just something that i wanted to\nrefine on my own so yeah uh me\npersonally i've never had any jaw\nsurgery or any any sort of surgery um\nbut i do want to get my under eye dark\ncircles uh improved a bit i do have some\nreally bad dark circles now just because\ni've been staying up really late\nso i'll probably get that revised uh\nwith lasers but that's about it um\nmoving on\nuh asia asia how do white cheekbones\ninfluence your overall facial aesthetic\nattractiveness we have covered this on\nthe uh on so many videos on this channel\non the podcast it's a very easy question\nwhy cheekbones um\nbasically\nit's a feminizing characteristic uh it's\ninfluenced by estrogen and\ni can't remember exactly where we showed\nthe research for this but it's\ninfluenced by estrogen so it's a\nfeminizing characteristic women tend to\nhave wider cheekbones in men but it's\nalso indicative of good mid facial\ndevelopment right so that's the main\nreason for why it's attractive because\nit indicates that your mid face your\nmaxilla your upper jaw is projected your\nface is forward grown and it's just it's\none of those features that comes with as\na package with all the other features\nlike a strong jaw uh you know desirable\nbrow ridge so these are things that all\ndevelop at the same time you know you\ncan't like have a strong cheekbone and\nthen have a weak jaw it doesn't really\nwork like that this comes as a package\nuh victor uh cube studio at jc i had a\nsimilar surgery tube but without the\ngenioplasty did you have your metal\nplates removed does the genioplasty\naffect your desire for jaw implants do\nyou want to answer the one really\nquickly jason uh yeah uh yeah i i just\nhave screws i just have metal screws i\ndon't know about metal plates but you\ncan feel the screws but you can't even\nsee them like i'm super lean so it's\njust like you can't see them at all and\nas far as like the jaw implant i want to\nhave a a square\njaw and so\nthat's the only reason why i'm doing a\ncustom-made kind of a jaw implant but\nyeah dreams asked is there any way to\nget hollow cheeks naturally uh basically\nyou either have the bone structure you\neither have the cheekbone projection and\nthe jaw width to get it um\nunderlying you might just have a lot of\nfat\nand so there is no way to really get it\nnaturally other than having the dental\nfacial the forward facial growth and you\nget that from your adolescence good\nhabits and genetics a bit but other than\nthat if you're fat then you can lean\ndown and have it show but i wouldn't\nreally say there's much else one note\nyour buckle fat will reduce as you get\nolder and that will hollow out your\ncheeks more so if you see uh like say\nzoe kravitz i think she did have surgery\nbut her cheek definitely hollowed out a\nlot more than when she was 20 and now\nshe's 33 or something so\nthere is something to look forward to if\nthat's the look you're going for you\nhave to make sure you stay lean and you\ntake care of yourself though\nby the way username one any ways to lose\nface fat you can't spot reduce fat just\nto let you know so when you lose fat in\ngeneral\nyou lose it all over your body you can't\nuh target any areas to lose fat\nyeah yeah you got to lose it as a whole\nit goes for any part of your body like\nespecially the abs people think they can\njust do crunches and get yeah it doesn't\nwork like that you gotta lose it as a\nwhole and the face if i remember\ncorrectly is\nwhere it comes off last right so you\nlose your face fast absolutely right at\nthe end because your body really doesn't\nwant to lose that fat it's needed for uh\nhealthy functioning\num\ndoctor romance how much does diet affect\nattractiveness again i would say 40 of\nyour physical attractiveness can be\nassociated with diet just off the top of\nmy head um will society ever stop\njudging people based on looks probably\nnot no we've been judging people based\non looks since since the earliest\nancestors animals do it\nin fact every animal does it\nit's a survival it's a survival instinct\nit's needed to form early impressions of\nwhat who we think might be friendly or\nunfriendly who we think might be healthy\nthat's the biggest one healthy and\nunhealthy because back in the day if you\nget if you caught leprosy from someone\nyou would just die right so it's not\nworth the risk of saying oh maybe i want\nto make a new friend but i might catch\nleprosy it's not worth it i i mean\nthat's why you can uh naturally tell by\nlooking at someone they have down\nsyndrome uh it's you can see what's\ngoing on internally by just looking at a\nperson\ndown syndrome does change the\na lot of the hormones though that's more\nof a but the reason the reason why we\nassociate down syndrome with a certain\nlook or negative perceptions is because\nwe you know it's a genetic anomaly so\nthat's why we perceive it that way\nwe're going to be on here for another\ntwo minutes and then we have to go\nlive on uh on tiktok yeah so we also\nhave so you guys really should follow us\non tech talk\nand for the course viewers we have a\ndiscord channel up now so i'll be there\nyou know\nevery a couple of times during the week\nso we can also talk about aesthetics\nthere just in a very casual way\nso the discord links jc's channel he's\nmaking a youtube now uh and he's\nbasically he's big on tech talk he\nexplains things in a much more simpler\nway than i do so you can also follow him\non youtube\na couple more questions really quickly\ndo braces sort out lower third\nasymmetries yes they do that's kind of\nthe whole point uh how can we widen the\nmouth without increasing the buccal\ncorridors\num that's a that's a very tricky\nquestion i think with widening the mind\nwith widening the mouth you need to get\nwhat's known as a palatial expander and\num if you do so that it's impossible to\nnot increase the buckle corridor this\nthis impression of the hollow cheek we\nmade a video on this there's something\ncalled pseudo projection and true\nprojection pseudo projection is the\nimpression of hollow cheeks but it's you\ndon't really have hollow cheeks and\ntroop\nsorry true projection is really having\nhollow cheeks because you have really\ndefined cheekbones and jaws so this is\ntwo different you can make it look like\nthat\ni i think on that note yeah i i think on\nthat note we have to close out just just\nbecause uh yeah tick-tock will get\nrubble yeah okay um so thank you for\neveryone for joining us uh\nthe discord link everything's in the bio\nof uh this uh\nit's in the buy but all of the stuff is\nin the buy for this uh thank you for\njoining us this week uh we will try to\ndo this more often and probably try to\ndo it for longer\nwe have been live for 40 minutes now but\nuh definitely trying to make this a\nrecurring thing we're going to be on\ntech talk right now so if you know our\ntextbooks just see us say we'll continue\nasking questions we just have to go\nthere now\nokay thank you jason you wanna say\nanything\nnope uh it's great talking with you guys\nthis uh my youtube is connected uh and\nyou guys can check me out there as well\nall right thank

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Video Title: \"I Was Bullied For My Malformity\" | How Physical Looks Affect Children"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "﻿How parent’s view their \nattractive/unattractive children\n \nToday we are going to be looking at a study \nby Blasio et al. on how parents perceive their  \nchild’s facial aesthetics and how it affects \ntheir social life, along with the expectations  \nset on pediatricians to diagnose \ndentofacial deformities. \n \nTo collect this info, parents were given a \nquestionnaire when visiting the pediatricians  \noffice to get a sample from the Italian \ngeneral population. Info like parent’s  \neducation and employment was asked to get \nan idea of the family environment. The first  \npart of the questionnaire asked questions on the \nparent’s perception of their child’s deformity,  \nwith 3 of the questions asking what the parents \nthought the child perceived their deformity as.  \nThe second part of the questionnaire asked a \nseries of questions on the importance of features.  \nThe first was if their child’s front view \nor profile could be considered as the most  \nimportant feature from an aesthetic point of view. \nSecond, if a specific area of the face could be  \nconsidered as the most important. This includes \nthings like the forehead, eyes, nose, lips, ears,  \nzygomatic area, teeth, chin or none in particular. \nThe third question was regarding which specific  \ndeformity could be considered the most important \nin the lower third of the face. This includes  \nthings like chin defects, chin excess, short \nface, long face, irregular dental arch and smile.  \n1214 questionnaires were collected over 30 days. \nThe data showed no notable differences in answers  \nbetween location, employment history, \nand overall familial conditions. \n \nThe first question was “Is the aesthetic aspect \nof the face generally considered as important,  \nduring childhood?” An overwhelming majority \n(74%) said it was very important, and the  \nrest still said it was important. The second \nquestion was, “Starting from what age may it be  \nconsidered important?” The large majority \n(86%) said it is always important from any age.  \nThis ties into the third question which \nasked if gender mattered in this importance  \nand almost all respondents said it did not. The \nfourth question asked “Do you think that your  \npediatrician should take care of it?” Almost all \nof the parents thought the pediatrician's role  \nshould extend not only to health, but to the \nattractiveness of the child too. Similarly,  \nthe next question was “ If necessary, would \nyou agree to adequate therapy for your child?”  \nThe majority of parents (68%) said they \nwould agree to craniofacial treatment,  \nwhile most of the rest said they had doubts. \nTying in is the next question, which asks what  \ncomplications parents would be afraid of. Pain and \nside effects were the main answers understandably.  \nThe last three questions ask about the child’s \nexperience. The first was “Is your child disturbed  \nby some psychological problem about his/her facial \naesthetics?” The majority of parents said their  \nchild had no subjective problems, while a minority \nhad small to severe issues with their appearance.  \nThe next question ties in age: About 50% \ndeveloped this issue as young as 5 years old  \nwhile the other 50% after 10 years old. So clearly \nself-perception on attractiveness begins early on,  \nespecially in severe cases of craniofacial \ndeformity. The third question about the children’s  \nexperience asked “Does your child have social \nproblems because of his/her facial aesthetics?”  \nOnly 1.8% reported issues, but a large \nproportion of parents did not even answer. \n \nThe next part of the questionnaire showed 82% of \nrespondents chose the profile as more important  \nthan the front view from an aesthetic standpoint. \nI think it is clear that the front view is more  \ninfluential on attractiveness, but in this context \nmaybe the side clues more into facial aesthetics  \nand craniofacial deformity. The teeth were ranked \nas most important, then the eyes, and nose last.  \nThis also seems a little distorted as \nyou would imagine the eyes being first.  \nStill, none of these were picked overwhelmingly \nover the others so it shows they rank close in  \nterms of importance; this makes sense because \nthey are all central facial features that grab  \nattention. For the lower third of the face, an \nirregular dental arch and smile was overwhelmingly  \nranked as most important and chin excess also \nimportant. Chin excess here being a negatively  \nperceived trait, hence the word excess. \nWhat this study tells us is that facial aesthetics  \naffect a child’s self perception and social \nconditions irrespective of age, gender,  \nor family environment. This makes sense as we can \nall remember the point at which we became aware of  \nlooks and looks-bias; this starts out \nas self-perception of attractiveness,  \nbut is also conditioned by the outside \nworld’s portrayal of attractiveness.  \nIf we are being constantly spoonfed \nimages of outwardly beautiful models,  \na child will likely self-reflect on their \nown facial aesthetics. Those with dentofacial  \ndeformity will be particularly susceptible to \nnegative self-perception and social outcomes.  \nParents thought pediatricians should be able \nto pick out these craniofacial deformities at  \nan early age and treat them accordingly with \nattention. The study did have limitations like  \na large majority of parents choosing not to answer \ncertain questions. There is also a large degree of  \nsubjectivity involved when ranking the importance \nof certain facial features, especially since  \nmost of the parents do not have a trained eye \nfor cephalometric and dentofacial markers.\n \nArguably the most important limitation was that \nit is purely based on the parent’s perception  \nof their children. To truly gauge how facial \naesthetics really plays into the life of these  \nkids, you would have to ask them. A parent can \nhave a hard time grasping just how influential  \nlooks are to a child’s self and societal \nperception. This is why facial assessment  \nand orthodontic treatment are crucial \nto addressing craniofacial issues early;  \nyou don’t want self-perception and social \nproblems to arise in the first place. \n \nA child’s looks are arguably even more important \namong their peers. In a study by Darla Lawson from  \nthe University of Tennessee at Chattanooga \ntitled, “ peer perception of physically  \nattractive children and prejudicial biases \nagainst physically unattractive children”,  \nthe evidence pointing towards the importance of \nfacial attractiveness is immense. We have talked  \nabout the ‘halo effect’ in past videos and in our \nQoves deep dive podcast, ‘the penalties of being  \nunattractive.” The core of this paper is this; \nThe suggestion that physical attractiveness is  \nrelated to intellect, social status, and personal \nachievement may seem absurd or unrealistic,  \nhowever, current research establishes it as \nfact. Physically attractive children are assumed  \nto have better characteristics than unattractive \nchildren. These perceptions are shaped, in part,  \nby the physical appearance of children.”\nThe study gauged perceptions of a group  \nof children who judged other children’s \nphotographs. The children were first judged  \non whether they were unattractive, average, \nor attractive in physical appearance. \n \nIn contrast to the ‘halo effect’ attractive \nchildren recieve, the study goes on to say  \n“physically unattractive children are often \ntaunted, harassed, and ridiculed (Byrnes,  \n1987). Unattractive children are believed to \nbehave antisocially and are also considered  \nstrange and less likeable (Smith, 1985). Serketich \nand Dumas (1997) found that adults judged the  \nexpected behaviors of photographed children on the \nsole basis of physical appearance. For instance,  \nadults judged unattractive children to be more \nanxious, aggressive, to fit in less socially,  \nand that they exhibit more behavioral \nproblems than do attractive children.  \nSmith (1985) found that among preschoolers who \nrated photographs of physically attractive and  \nunattractive children, judged the unattractive \ngirls as having less desirable characteristics  \nas far as being less social and more aggressive. \nHe believed that the beautiful is good stereotype  \ncould contribute to the development of negative \nself perceptions due to the prejudices made  \ntowards unattractive children, namely females.”  \nThis is the ‘devil’ effect or negative halo effect  \nwe touched on in the podcast, but it just \nmeans negative trait associations solely  \nbased on looks in this case.\nThe 2017 Movie ‘Wonder’ is a perfect  \nrepresentation of the treatment and reactions a \nchild’s facial characteristics can elicit. Augie,  \nplayed by Jacob Trembalay, is depicted as having \na severe form of a genetic condition called  \nTreacher Collins syndrome. This genetic anomaly \naffects his facial structure and appearance;  \nit is an extreme example, but it shows the extent \nto which our appearance matters. A child can be  \nbullied and receive a negative feedback loop for \nbeing unattractive; children judged by their peers  \nand parents to have high facial attractiveness \ncan live a completely opposite reality.  \nResults of the study showed that there were \nsignificant prejudices against the photographs  \nof the physically unattractive children. \nHildebrandt a Fitzgerald (1983), along with the  \nstudy done by Boyatzis, Batoff, and Durieux (1998) \nwould confirm the effect physical attractiveness  \nhas on a child’s perceived characteristics and \ntreatment. The children judged as attractive  \nby their peers were overwhelmingly looked at \npositively in areas of social status, intellect,  \nand success. The unattractive children were rarely \never chosen favorably in those areas. In general,  \nlow attractiveness is strongly associated with \nnegative traits like lack of intellect, dirtiness,  \nand lack of success. In some areas like who the \njudges thought would be happily married, physical  \nattractiveness mattered less. This also applied \nto picking teammates for a sports team, where the  \nstrongest, meanest looking kids were prioritized. \nThere were even male or female dependent biases  \nirrespective of attractiveness. The study did \nhave limitations like sample size and a lack  \nof ethnic diversity; while the study did include \na range of racial groups, more photos and ethnic  \ngroups would help broaden the scope. It would be \ninteresting to see if this attractiveness bias  \nextends to middle schoolers and high schoolers, \nnot just students 7-12 years old. I suspect it  \napplies to all group settings regardless of \nage, but it could be the case that younger  \nchildren are especially judgemental. The final \nnote the author makes is to have more prejudice  \nself awareness. Instead of trying to force away \nprejudices, just being aware of them can reduce  \nthe outward expression of such bias against \nphysically unattractive children. \n \nThat is the end of the video* \npodcast, qoves report, etc."}]}

The reason why a tall  \nand defined ramus is important is because of \nits shape and positioning it essentially acts  \nas a lever arm for bite force on your face. Your \nmasseter muscles, which are responsible for the up  \nand down movement of your jaw aren’t strong enough \non their own to cut through all the tough foods  \nyour ancestors would have been eating. For this \nwe need what’s known as a mechanical advantage,  \nto amplify the force your bite muscles \nput out. Quick physics here, your masseter  \nmuscles contract when you want to bite and the \nentire lower jaw revolves around this hinge  \nhere at the head of the mandible. The further \naway the force is being applied from the hinge,  \nthe longer the lever arm is and thus the greater \nthe amplification effect, just like a see-saw.  \nThe lever arm in this case is the ramus, and you \ncan imagine how well defined jaws usually have a  \nlonger ramus and a bit of slope to increase the \nlever arm. Recessed faces on the other hand have  \na short and near vertical ramus and so the force \nis being applied very close to the hinge and the  \nbite force is relatively lower and weaker. This is \nsignificant because much of our facial development  \nearly on is due to the forces we place on it, \nsuch as from our diets as we covered here, using  \nthe works of Dr Weston Price. Your body doesn’t \nneed as much mechanical force if you’re consuming  \na soft diet during puberty and adolescence or \nif you’re always mouth breathing, and so the  \nlower jaw’s development is shrunk, and the ramus \nis both short and vertical which isn’t ideal.  \nFrom a biomechanical point of view, a 45 degree \nangle, aka a diagonal ramus angle would be best at  \nmaximising this mechanical advantage because it’s \nfurthest away from the hinge and gives you enough  \nheight and clearance to chew properly. A more \nsloped ramus, say past this 45 degree theoretical  \nbest, also leads to reducing mechanical advantage, \nand women tend to have more of these sloped shapes  \ncompared to men with square, sloped jaws which is \npartially why their bite force is lower too.\n \nCan I Change The Ramus?\nSurprisingly you can but not  \nexactly the ramus by itself. Bone can remodel \nitself but its dependant on so many factors.  \nFom Huumonen et al, Longitudinal studies have \nshown that remodelling of the mandibular bone  \noccurs with age, Age and systemic factors as well \nas loss of teeth may change the gonial angle.  \nHealth related factors like Rheumatoid disease can \nmodify the bony structures of the mandible too.  \nSaleh and colleagues tells us that masticatory \nforces exerted are different for males and  \nfemales, which influence the shape and the \nsize of the mandibular ramus. In simple terms,  \nmen have square jaws because they bite harder and \nvice versa. This is very much a chicken or the egg  \nproblem because squarer jaws also allow you to \nbite harder as a result so what came first? The  \nmost noticeable change in ramus, in my opinion, \ncomes from edentulous individuals. If you have  \nyour teeth all intact, you are considered dentate, \nand if they have all fallen out, such as with age,  \nthen you are edentulous. As you can imagine, \nnot having any teeth completely changes the  \nbiomechanics of your jaw and what would once \nclose with a perfect seal because of your teeth,  \nnow has to extend the lower jaw further to close \nproperly. From the study, ramus height changed  \nby a mm for both men and women and while this may \nnot seem significant, the bigger, more noticeable  \nchanges were to the gonial angle. This term \nwill get its own episode soon, but for now,  \nit’s the angle of your jaw at a point known as \nthe gonion which we’ll talk about in a second.  \nA higher gonial angle is more feminine, with \nstudies listing 135 degrees and above as feminine  \nand 130 and below as masculine. In all cases of \nedentulousness, which is often associated with old  \nage and weakening masseter muscles, the jaw angle \nincreases supporting the idea that the ramus does  \nstrongly influence or is influenced by the bite \nforce being applied to it. It adapts. If you want  \na stronger, more masculine jaw, chew harder \nfoods and give your body a reason to use it,  \nbut understand this is a lifelong change of \nlifelong effort, not a once a day exercise you do.  \nWe spoke about this indepth on the \nGlow Up podcast which is a podcast  \ndedicated to actual advice you can follow.\nGoing back to Saleh and colleague they found the  \nmedian ramus height to be 8.6 (7.93-9.03)cm for \nmen and 7.28 (6.88-7.74)cm for women. Mind you,  \nI’m giving you these values here, \nwhich is the condylar ramus height,  \nmeaning that it goes straight into the socket \nthat lets your jaw move. The ramus is one of those  \nfacial characteristics where the average value \nis typically the most preferred or attractive  \nand granted that this is an Egyptian study, the \nvalues are more or less similar around the world  \nbecause it’s a small part of your face anyway. \nWe can also predict one’s age from their ramus,  \nwhich is useful in forensics when all you have \nleft is the skeleton, or even just the jaw.  \nTaking an average ramus height of say 8cm, \nwe can plug it into the formula for a male  \ngetting a predicted age of 34, which is close to \nthe actual age of the average of the sample they  \nused in this group. It’s easy to understand how a \nyoung boy would have a ramus height much smaller  \nthan a grown man. We can also predict sex from the \nramus height, using a similar function. Where if  \nyour values from the formula are around 0.681 \nthen your ramus is more masculine, and if its  \naround -0.831 than its more feminine.\nHow this affects your facial aesthetic\n \nNow that you know the basics of why the ramus \nexists, what the average expected values for  \nit are and how it can possibly change, let’s talk \nabout how this affects your facial aesthetic. Here  \nis a morph of a girl with a normal side profile \nof average ramus length and jaw angle, and here  \nis her with a shorter ramus. It definitely makes \nthe jawline appear sharper and more svelte, but  \nit is a feminising characteristic. Remember all \nthose numbers we went over, women on average had  \nlower ramus lengths and higher gonial angles than \nmen, and so, as we reduce the ramus length here,  \nit adds youthfulness and femininity to the face, \ngoing back so far to that of a young girl. Do  \nthe reverse and the face is masculinized very \ngreatly. With men on the other hand, it works  \nto their advantage in making the jaw larger and \nmore imposing, which is obviously a dimorphic aka  \nmasculine characteristic, within limit of course. \nThere are few nuances to this which might be a bit  \nmuch for a newbie entry video, but lets touch on \nthem anyway. If you want to catch the rest of this  \nseries, then please do subscribe. Firstly, \nnotice how on this young man, we can see  \nthe shadow of his jaw gonion. Quick recap, the \njaw gonion is this anatomical region of the jaw,  \nand if your jaw is very wide it will pull the skin \non the sides tightly, assuming you are also lean.  \nBeing able to see the ramus is a big part \nof the attractiveness of the jawline,  \nand we’ve covered this in many of \nour videos on the side profile.  \nHaving the shadow be visible is the difference \nbetween a round, puffy face that is seen as  \ncute at best compared to a sharp angular \nface that is seen as hot, striking or sensual  \nand this applies for both men and women. The \nlittle shadows we see on a face reveal crucial  \ndepth perception characteristics that make the \nface appear angular and lean, even if you are not  \nnecessarily lean in terms of bodyfat. They also \nsubtly indicate healthy dentofacial development,  \nas the shadow we see here is really only \nvisible if your jaw is properly developed  \nenough to pull the skin tightly. A recessed \njaw has virtually no shadows and is a soft,  \nconcave shape with no angles. The ramus border \nis invisible, there are no jawline shadows  \nand the face is overall very flat. An angular, \ndeveloped face, regardless of lighting conditions  \nwill almost always have this ramus shadow because \nthe region is notably sunken in for most people  \nas it sits behind the most laterally wide part of \nthe jaw. If you’re wondering why your face looks  \nsoft and smooth, one of the most common ways we \ncan explain this to the patients who come to us  \nfor an assessment is by adding shadows to their \nexisting bone structure in Photoshop. This is an  \nexaggerated example to show you how shadows change \njawline definition in photoshop. In the original  \nher jaw gonion is very flat and virtually non \nexistent, hence it has no bordering shadow, but by  \nadding it back in with Photoshop, the definition \nis very clear to see and we’ve essentially created  \na feature that wasn't there originally. \nAfter this video you’ll start to notice that the  \nlength of the ramus, it’s slope and angle and the \nshadow it produces are very much one of the key  \nfeatures for an attractive jaw. We’ll cover the \nremainder of the featues in the future episodes  \nof this series of Facial Aesthetics 101.\nIf you would like to get your face assessed,  \nto learn about whether you have a masculine or \nfeminine ramus, your jaw angles and how they  \naffect your face or just get an indepth look into \nyour face order a QOVES facial evaluation over at  \nour website, performed by our in-house team of \ndoctors and dentists to help you achieve that  \nnext big glow-up.

reason\nhe's stopped doing jawline exercises so\ni'm gonna\ntell you if the reasons he's giving uh\nlegitimate what my thoughts are and\nwe're gonna take a discussion and that i\nstopped was to slow down my wrinkling\nyou see white people people with less\nmelanin in melanin and melanin in their\nskin actually wrinkle a lot faster than\npeople who do because they are a lot\nmore sensitive to the sun because you\nknow we originate from areas that are a\nlot less directly impacted by the sun so\nwe don't have to develop thicker\nstronger skin like people who have\ndarker complexions do and as you guys\nknow there are muscles within your face\nand these muscles are responsible for\nfacial expressions we use them every\ntime we smile or frown and the more\nfacial expressions you do\nthose actually get drawn on your face in\nthe form of wrinkles and lines so if you\nsee people that smile a lot they have\nthese smile lines these okay well\nfirstly two things that he pointed out\nthat are very much true you do have less\nmelon as a caucasian european male and\nfor that reason\nit does make you more prone to sun\ndamage which is something we've covered\nextensively on the channel\nvery much true\nthe wrinkling is also another factor\npattern deficient movements in general\ncan lead to those wrinkles being\nimprinted on the skin\npermanently so\nthe actual causation of him trying to\nmaybe suggest that jawline exercises are\ngoing to lead to more wrinkling\nit's i don't really agree with that\nbecause when you think about it how\noften\nyour jawline exercises are like\nmaybe 15 20 minutes of your day tops\nthey're minimally\nthey're not extreme movements they're\nnot something that you do for the rest\nof your life\nthese crows feet that's me i got these\ncrow's feet coming in so that was my\nfirst sign that i need a whoa whoa whoa\nchill out with the facial expression and\nif you're doing a lot of jawline\nexercises you know that xo face and all\nthese different things that's gonna do a\nlot of stretching to your skin you're\nactivating a lot of those facial muscles\nthat are pulling on your skin and making\nyou wrinkle a lot faster so i decided to\njust cut that out all together because\ni'm actually pretty happy with where my\njawline is at i've been training it for\nyears\nokay another point here and he does have\na very valid case that because he's\nnoticing some wrinkling he wants to cut\nit out all together even if the actual\nexercises are not what's causing the\nwrinkling i understand why you'd want to\ncut out jawline exercises altogether\njust in case it is what's causing those\nfactors now with a lot of these\naesthetic uh routines that people have\noften times it's not really worth the\nminor gains that you get from doing it\nbeing a detriment to something else a\ngood example for me personally was with\ncreatine apparently there's a study\ngoing around that creatine does lead to\nsome cases of hair loss and it's not for\neveryone and it is it has been debunked\nbut still\ni er on the side of caution and i just\nstopped taking it completely because in\nmy workouts i never really noticed much\nof a benefit from it anyway so\nmaybe he's doing the same thing with the\njawline exercises\nmay the benefit of it i personally from\nthe research we've seen\nit does work but\nit\ntakes a lot of time and it takes a lot\nof effort and the results that you get\nare not as significant as people want to\nbelieve people like to think that\njawline exercises work because it gives\nthem a at home method of controlling\nit's a very deterministic thing you can\ncontrol the way your face looks by just\ndoing these exercises you can just like\nwith any other muscle you can you feel\nlike you're growing stronger you're\ngetting better at it by doing something\nat home whereas with the jawline the\nfacial muscles especially with the\nfacial muscles they're very robust and\nthey require a lot of extra\ntough movements to really get them going\nmuch like the forearm muscles as well\nthey require a lot of extra work for\nvery little gain and they're very\ndifficult to train as well and i decided\nwhy not take this one element out of the\nroutine the next reason is i just didn't\nfind it being effective enough for my\ntime\nyou know i invested a lot exactly as i\nsaid i didn't feel as much activation\nand stimulation in my jaw and facial\nmuscles as i did with things like mewing\nor just bolus chewing you know chewing a\nton of gum i feel that the most i feel\nit so much in my masseter muscles over\nhere so in my experience i just found it\nnot really being\nas effective as i would have liked it to\nbe now that's not to say that it doesn't\nwork most professionals do agree that\njawline exercises do stimulate growth in\nyour face let's take a look at what this\nnice lady had to say like do jawline\nexercises actually work they definitely\nhelp because the tightness in the\njawline is somewhat is due to the muscle\nstrength and the muscles especially at\nthe corners of the jaw if you exercise\nthem and bulk them up a little bit will\ntighten and pull the jawline back but i\njust found in my particular case\nit wasn't effective enough and i could\nbetter spend my time doing other things\nthat's not to say you shouldn't at all\nif you are a die hard\ngo gator trying to get that jawline baby\nthen by all means do everything you can\nto help your jawline mewing bowles\nchewing chewing hard foods as well as\nthe jawline exercises but for me i found\nthat the most\nokay so my recommendation here is again\nis correct that jawline exercises they\nhave they do work but the return on\ngains is quite minimal and this is why\nbecause our recommendation is oftentimes\nto go with the non-surgical option and\nthis may be like dermal fillers or um\ncoolsculpting there's different options\nthat you can go do at a\nuh aesthetic clinic or like a medical\nspa whatever they're called in your\ncountry\nand that's just because the jawline\nexercises you do every single day for\nthe rest of your life maybe not the rest\nof it maybe the next 10 years\nare going to have such minimal gains in\ncomparison to a maybe 500 dermal filler\nwhich is going to give you very\nimmediate results and look a lot a lot\nmore natural because it spread out more\nevenly compared to the jawline exercises\nwhich work particularly the masseters\nwhich bulk up as she was saying the lady\nas you were saying it works up the go\nkneel muscles so the masseter which\nconnects at that point it's going to\ngive you a very triangle-shaped look and\nand brett is a good example of that he\nit's very clear to see from brett's face\nthat he does do these exercises because\nof how pronounced his dimples are\nwhich is much more than the normal\nperson and also you can just see a lot\nmore mass on his inferior mandible\noutline which is basically this lower\noutline here\nand so these factors do indicate that he\ndoes do the work he has gotten some\nresults but for me personally i would\nrecommend that you go to a clinic and\njust get some augmentation done because\nit is much easier and a better use of\nyour time than doing this every single\nday for the next\nmaybe 10 years before you get any kind\nof significant results and it's also\nright uh the bowlers chewing that is\nalso more effective and we're going to\nmake a video on that very soon\nmost important thing is just mewing\nkeeping that tongue up and chewing lots\nof gum now those of you who don't know\nwhat mewing is we talk about it all the\ntime but it's basically comes down to\njust proper tongue posture and what that\nconsists of is having your tongue\npressed up against the roof of your\nmouth at all times especially in the\nback right here because this actually\nconditions your face to grow upwards and\nforwards giving you better facial\nstructure and a better jawline actually\nand if you do it for long enough and\nfrom a young age you can actually get\nmore prominent cheekbones so if you want\nto know more about that go watch some of\nmy other videos and uh there's plenty of\ncontent out there on that now that\nbrings us to the final thing that might\nbe a reason why you in particular\nmight want to consider stopping jawline\nexercises and that is the danger of tmj\nor bruxism or some type of jaw joint\nproblem a lot of people tmj is temporary\nmandibular disorder and\ntemporomandibular joint disorder and it\nis very significant it's going to be\nsomething i was going to mention if he\ndid it himself it would probably for me\nbe the primary reason for not doing\njawline exercises\nbecause the cartilage in your joint\nbetween your jaw and your actual skull\nis very sensitive and cartilage\nregeneration is near impossible with\ncurrent technology so once that\ncartilage gets damaged from excess\npressure you can imagine as you're\ntrying to chew very hard foods that\ncartilage is going under an incredible\namount of friction and stress once that\ncartilage deteriorates it's gone for\ngood so you're kind of screwed there\nthat's gonna be lifelong chronic pain\nthat is not worth getting a more defined\njaw\nand even the more defined draw results\nare very\nminimal at best\nwill have tmj from some sort of injury\nor over using their jaw or having prior\nacute jaw joint problems and that that\nis damage to your temporomandibular\njoint\nin your jaw you get this clicking this\ngrinding and pain and sometimes even\nlocking of your jaw and if you have\nprior acute jaw joint problems then if\nyou're doing a bunch of jawline\nexercises where you're stimulating and\nusing that joint a lot you can actually\num you know kind of activate that\nproblem and you don't want to do that so\ni personally don't have jaw joint\nproblems i've been doing jawline\nexercises and mewing and eating tough\nfoods for years now and i've never had\nany pain or anything like that so i know\nthat i could get away with doing that\nbut you might not be able to\nand if you want to know if you do\nthere's a couple little quick tests you\ncan do first one we just call the thumb\ntest just take your thumbs put them\nright here where\nyour mandible\nmeets\nthe upper palate\nput it in there open and close your jaw\nand if you feel any clicking or popping\nor severe pain\nthen you might have prior jaw joint\nproblems and you probably shouldn't be\ndoing excessive jawline exercises\nthe next one is just a uh diameter test\na dilation test if you will and for this\ni just call it the fingertips test you\njust make a\nbig open mouth\ntake your fingers like this and try to\nget at least three fingers in there\ncontinue doing these jawline exercises\nand whatnot but if you feel pain\nyou probably should take it really easy\nand maybe just stick to mewing and\nchewing a lot of gum so it's important\nto know this before you commit to any\nsort of training regimen or over\nstimulation of your job because you\ndon't want to end up with injury i'm not\nokay so it basically goes on to say\ndon't do this because i'm taking\nliability for your um problems and if\nyou have joy injuries don't do it now\npersonally if you have\njustly i would recommend not doing\njawline exercises full stop it's just\nnot worth the risk of tmj and tmj can\nhappen to anybody even with without\nthese issues probably\nif you're\nmost dentists do not recommend doing\njawline exercises using heavy like the\njaw size the device for instance and\nanybody who does is trying to sell you\nsomething the risks of tmj are so\nso significant that the excess pressure\nthat you put on your jaw by trying to\nchew on these devices in the hopes of\nstimulating your masseter muscles or\nhypertrophying your masseter muscles is\njust not worth the chronic lifelong pain\nthat you will get\nnow what does this mean for you well in\nterms of jaw exercises there are some\noptions there are certain exercises that\ni don't think are as harmful as others\nanything that you can do with your mouth\nregarding chewing so generally just\nchewing gum is not a bad habit it can\nalso help with\ntongue activation which is more\nimportant\nrather than the actual bite force that\nyou're trying to exhibit the tongue\nposture is very much significant to\nthe actual facial development rather\nthan just the\namount of bite force that you can\nexhibit which is\nwhat the jaw sizer device is trying to\nsell you on that's my advice with your\nexercises again the final line is that\nyou can do them but just stick to gum\nchewing gum and the the bit and the\nbasic ones like the exo like you're\nshowing the um the one that's like when\nyou move your mouth around there'll be\nsomething on screen for that but avoid\nproducts that enforce heavy by force\nthat is not what you want you do not\nneed by force to get a wider jaw you\nneed proper tongue posture you want to\nmove your tongue around you really want\nto work that tongue because that's\nwhat's more effective\nif you want to get an aesthetic report\nand get your face analyzed by our team\nof doctors and dentists you can go to\nthe curve's website i also suggest that\nyou guys follow us on instagram and tech\ntalk we have dedicated content there and\nit's just it's a lot of aesthetic\ncontent and we really work on educating\nthe population and facial aesthetics and\nsome of the dangers of like products\nlike the draw sizer\n[Music]"}]}

The  \nskin loses its elasticity with age, becoming \nmore wrinkled, less supple with different  \nchanges. People try to use various cosmetics \nand procedures to try and get back their old  \nskin. There are many methods to do this, and one \nof them is using injectable botulinum toxin.\n \nBotulinum toxin is a toxin derived from a bacteria \ncalled Clostridium botulinum. It is a highly  \ntoxic substance that stops the release of the \nneurotransmitter acetylcholine from nerve endings  \nin nerve and muscle junctions. There are mainly \nseven botulinum neurotoxins. These are types A,  \nB, C (C1, C2), D, E, F, and G. Human botulism is \ncaused mainly by types A, B, E, and sometimes by  \nF. However, some of its forms have medicinal and \ncosmetic value, with the most commonly used one  \ncalled onabotulinumtoxinA. Application of \nbotulinum toxin in an injectable form is  \na common method used in relieving stress lines on \nthe face and reducing wrinkles. As a person ages,  \nthe skin starts to lose its elasticity leading \nto wrinkles. Botulinum toxin works by blocking  \nsignals from nerves to muscles and making them \nunable to contract. This process smoothes out  \nthe skin and thus, helps reduce wrinkles. \nBotulinum toxin has been gaining enough popularity  \nover the last few decades, with better and more \nsafe procedure methods being developed for using  \nit. It has been extensively studied and been \napproved for treatment for multiple conditions.  \nHowever, there are still some \nmisunderstandings and myths related  \nto getting this toxin shot. \nSome of these myths are: \n \nMyth 1. Botulinum toxin injections \nare toxic and dangerous. \n \nWhile botulinum toxin in its pure form \nis extremely dangerous, the ones used for  \nmedicinal and aesthetic purposes are safe to use. \nThese injectable forms are proteins derived from  \nthe bacteria that produce this toxin. They are \nchemically tested and have been approved by the  \nFDA for different uses. They have also been proven \nto be safe for use in aesthetic medicine.  \n \nHowever, like most other medications, botulinum \ntoxin injections also have some side effects.  \nThese include bruising, pain at injection \nsites, headache, excess flaccidity of the  \nmuscles, and rarely, hypersensitivity \nreactions to this substance. \n \nMyth 2: Botulinum toxin causes 'frozen face'. \nThere is a belief that using botulinum toxin  \ncan cause the freezing of the muscles of facial \nexpressions leading to an inexpressive face. This,  \nhowever, is usually because of an overdose. \nIf done by an experienced injector, who knows  \nthe exact amount of this substance to inject, \nthere are very few chances of this happening. So  \nit is always good to get it done by experienced \npersonnel who are used to doing this. \n \nMyth 3: Botulinum toxin can \nget rid of all wrinkles. \n \nThere are mainly two kinds of \nwrinkles, dynamic and static.  \nDynamic ones are made with facial movement. These \ninclude frown lines, crow's feet, laugh lines,  \nforehead wrinkles, etc. These wrinkles appear \nwith facial expressions and then disappear. \n \nThe static wrinkles are present at rest and \ndeepen with age. These include lines at the  \ncorners of the mouth, over the cheeks, and along \nthe neck. With age, the collagen levels of the  \nskin decrease, decreasing the elasticity, \nand dynamic wrinkles will become static  \nwrinkles. And while botulinum toxin injections \ncan treat both wrinkles, the static ones may need  \nother treatment as well, such as fillers. \nBotulinum toxin injections can decrease the frown  \nlines around the glabella, crow’s feet \nat the side of eyes, forehead creases,  \nwrinkles around the mouth, nasolabial folds, \nand smoothing out the wrinkles of the neck,  \nchest, and cleavage.\nMyth 4: Botulinum toxin is  \nused only to treat wrinkles. \nBotulinum toxin has multiple  \nuses. While it is commonly used in \ndecreasing the number of wrinkles,  \nit is also used to elevate eyebrows and treat skin \nproblems like lichen simplex, pompholyx, and acne.  \nIt has been approved for use in the treatment of \nlaryngeal dystonia, hyperhidrosis, strabismus,  \nblepharospasm, neurogenic detrusor overactivity, \nchronic migraine, upper limb spasticity. \n \nMyth 5: Botulinum toxin injections are painful\nWith the proper application of local anesthetic,  \nbotulinum toxin injections are not painful. Even \nwith no numbing agent, the pain is minimal. This  \nprocedure is quick, and under the hands of trained \npersonnel, it may finish before you even realize  \nthat you have been injected. Studies are \nunderway to reduce even the minimal pain  \nof injecting this agent with the help of \nother drugs such as nitrous oxide. \n \nMyth 6: The effect of \nbotulinum toxin is permanent\n \nThe effects of botulinum toxin last only for about \n3 to 4 months. Following this period, the muscles  \nwill start regaining their strength, and the \nwrinkles may reappear. Botulinum toxin takes about  \n24 hours to start working after being injected \nwith maximum effects up to 1 to 4 weeks. After the  \neffects wear off, reinjecting this substance is \nnecessary to lessen the wrinkles once again. \n \nMyth 7: Botulinum toxin can cause addiction\nBotulinum toxin is not physically addictive and  \nwill not cause dependence. However, in some \ncases, the person may become too used to  \nthe effects of Botox on their skin and this may \ncause them to get the treatment repeatedly. \n \nMyth 8:Botulinum toxin affects the whole body\nBotulinum toxin injection only affects the  \nmuscles where it is injected. Its effects are \nlimited to only one muscle or muscle group.  \nHence, they cannot spread \nto other parts of the body."}]}

"assistant", "content": "Frown lines are fine lines and wrinkles that\ndevelop on your forehead, between your eyes,\nand on your nose as time passes.\nFrown lines are an apparent cosmetic problem\nthat not only affects the aesthetics of the\nface but also the self-worth and esteem of\nthe person.\nThe presence of frown lines automatically\nmakes a person appear older than they actually\nare.\nThis alteration in self-perception and perception\nby others can take a toll on people’s mental\nhealth, making frown lines a significant psychological\nburden.\nFrown lines give the face a constantly annoyed\nor angry appearance which can limit one’s\nsocial and personal life.\nThis adds to the psychological burden of frown\nlines and is often the reason why people choose\nto undergo invasive treatments to rid themselves\nof frown lines.\nAlso known as the vertical elevens, frown\nlines are the result of several factors working\ntogether rather than one main etiological\nfactor.\nThese factors include:\n* Aging: As one age, the skin loses elasticity\nand its collagen content, which is important\nfor the structural integrity of the skin.\nThe loss of these components becomes visible\nin the form of fine lines and wrinkles, which\nare especially exaggerated in sun-exposed\nareas and areas of repetitive muscle contraction.\n* Sun exposure: UV rays have the same effect\non the skin as the aging process which is\nwhy skin damage from sun exposure is referred\nto as photodamage.\nConstant sun exposure destroys the collagen\nand elastin content of the skin, resulting\nin fine lines, wrinkles, and eventually droopiness\nof the skin.\n* From Flament et al’s paper, sun exposure\nwas responsible for over 80% of the visible\nageing signs in a Caucasian sample.\nMind that in a previous video on skin colour\nand sun exposure we mentioned that those higher\nin melanin will be more tolerant of sun exposure\nfor ageing...\n* Smoking: Nicotine and tobacco in cigarettes\nresult in the formation of fine lines and\nwrinkles all over the face by constricting\nblood vessels of the skin.\nThis decreases the oxygen supply of the skin\nand makes it susceptible to damage from environmental\ntoxins.\nFrom Facial Wrinkling in Men and Women, by\nSmoking Status by Emster et al…\nHowever the results arent as clear cut that\nsmoking is the direct cause of wrinkling.\nThose who have never smoked in the male group\nhave almost the same amount of wrinkling as\nheavy chain smokers in the 60-69 group, but\nthis is likely an outlier as for all other\ngroups, heavy smokers have the greatest severity\nof wrinkling.\nWith the female group, this correlation is\nfar more linear and easier to see.\nIf I had to guess what may have caused this\noutlier, men typically get more sun exposure\nwith a greater number of men participating\nin manual labour work than women and so as\nsun exposure is the real culprit of skin degradation,\nsmoking just slows down repair, the researchers\ndid not control for even levels of sun exposure\nin each group.\n* Stress: When we’re stressed, we release\na hormone called cortisol.\nWhile this is normal for regular human functioning,\nchronic exposure, in other words being stressed\nall the time is detrimental to skin health.\nFrom Cortisol Control and Beauty by Dr Shawn\nTalbott, Cortisol is reported to have a destructive\neffect on Collagen.\nWhile Dr Talbott has written a plethora of\nknowledge in his book, let’s keep it straight\nto the point with Drielen et al’s study\nfinding an increase in perceived age correlated\nwith fasted cortisol levels.\nWhile endocrinology is incredibly complex\nand even the authors of this study acknowledge\nthat disentangling the effects of different\nhormones is hard, it should be fairly intuitive\nthat chronic stress is bad for general health.\nConstantly furrowing your eyes in anger is\na surefire way to embed frown lines into your\nface.\n* Facial expressions and repeated muscle use:\nSquinting and frowning, along with expression\nof anger and frustration requires the use\nof the glabellar complex muscles.\nThis is supported by Hillebrand et al’s\n2010 study which was taken over 8 years, finding\na predictive effect between those who persistently\nuse the same facial expressions and how those\nform into defined wrinkles later on in life.They\nalso suggested that having a drier, more alkaline\nand drier stratum corneum (in simple terms\nhaving dry skin) with a lighter complexion\nand being middle aged or menopausal speed\nup the process\nAlthough all of these factors work together\nand result in the development of frown lines,\nrepeated use of the glabellar complex and\nsun exposure dominate as the major cause over\nthe other risk factors.\nFrown lines appear in several patterns and\ncan be of different types depending on exactly\nwhich facial muscle is under the most strain\nwhen forming facial expressions like frowning.\nFrown lines appear on the forehead and space\nbetween the eyes, known as the glabella.\nThey can either be horizontal, vertical, or\noblique and generally, appear in one of the\nfollowing five patterns:\n* V-shaped Frown lines: This is the most common\npattern of frown lines as it affects approximately\n37 percent of the affected individuals.\nThese frown lines pull the inner edge of eyebrows\ninward resulting in frown lines that form\na V.\n* U-shaped frown lines: This pattern is the\nsecond most common pattern and involves elevation\nof the outer eyebrow along with the features\nof V-shaped frown lines.\n* Converging arrows-shaped frown lines: This\npattern is seen when only the inside of the\nbrows are affected and come closer to each\nother with facial expressions.\n* Omega frown lines: This pattern includes\nlowering of the outside of the eyebrows and\nelevation of the inner side of the eyebrows.\n* Inverted Omega frown lines: This pattern\nis rarely seen and is commonly associated\nwith the flattened nasal shape.\nThe best way I can explain it is through this\nmeme\nThe diagnosis process is quite straightforward\nas a simple examination of the frown lines\nby a doctor is more than enough for the diagnosis\nto be made.\nWhen performing the physical examination,\nthe doctor will pay special attention to facial\nanatomy and anatomy of facial expression,\nas in which muscle is being contracted the\nmost with each expression.\nThis helps the doctor have a better understanding\nof the frown lines and provides significant\nclues about possible treatment methods.\nGenerally, frown lines can be treated using\ntopical agents or injectables, depending on\nthe depth of the facial lines and patient\npreference.\nThere are also several homemade remedies in\nthe form of avocado masks, coconut oil massages\nand so on that can be done in the early phases\nof frown line development, however, there\nis no scientific evidence backing up their\nalleged benefits.\nThe topical agents that can treat frown lines\nare available in lotion, gel, and creme form.\nTo ensure maximum results, it is recommended\nto use topical agents with at least one of\nthe following ingredients:\n* Hyaluronic Acid: It is a natural component\nof the skin that decreases as time passes\nand one age.\nTopical use of this ingredient helps rejuvenate\nthe skin as hyaluronic acid is responsible\nfor the stimulation of collagen and elastin\nsynthesis along with hydration of the skin.\n… but the effect isn’t as great as you\nwould expect, but it is better than nothing.\nFrom Nobile Et al’s study on hyaluronic\nefficacy…\nJegasothy’s study saw smaller molecule hyaluronic\nacid being more effective with reported rates\nof upto 40%\n* Retinol: It is a form of Vitamin A with\nsignificant anti-aging properties.\nUsing topical retinol has been associated\nwith increased collagen content and it does\nso by promoting collagen synthesis at a genetic\nlevel.\nRetinol upregulates the genes responsible\nfor collagen production which reduces facial\nlines and wrinkles significantly.\nUnlike Tretinoin which is used in heavy duty\nacne medication, and we did talk all about\nthis in this video, retinols have a lower\nrisk of skin redness and irritation which\nmakes them perfect for over the counter cosmetics.\nFrom Fisher Et al 1996, Retinol was found\nto inhibit UV intake, i.e. reducing photodamage,\nwhile also stimulating collagen synthesis\nthrough genetic stimulation.\n* Niacinamide: Niacinamide or Vitamin B3 also\nhas anti-aging properties, along with anti-pruritic\nand anti-inflammatory properties.\nThis ingredient is especially helpful in treating\nfrown lines that have developed as the result\nof UV exposure and photodamage.\nNiacinamide reverses the damage done by sunlight,\nnamely hyperpigmentation and wrinkles.\nNiacinimide has been shown to improve fine\nlines, but nothing substantial in the way\nof heavy wrinkles like you would expect from\nfrown lines.\nThe injectable treatment of frown lines includes\nthe use of botulinum toxin type A or BOTOX\nand dermal fillers containing hyaluronic acid,\ncollagen, hydroxylapatite, and Poly-L-lactic\nacid.\nBOTOX injections smoothen the skin by preventing\nthe overactive facial muscles from contracting\nand straining the overlying skin.\nDermal fillers, on the other hand, reduce\nfrown lines by injecting components that promote\nwound healing and repair the skin from \nthe inside.\nIt \nis important to \nnote \nthat \ndermal \nfillers only last \nfor approximately six months."}]}

and Body Shapes For Clothing"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hello and welcome back to our channel\ntoday we're looking at formal model\nranks stranger's attractiveness by cut\napparently this one is really\ncontroversial so i'm going to be giving\nyou some actual\nuh look improving facial aesthetics\nadvice so let's just get into it stay\ncomfortable in your health\ndamn\nhello hi do you feel comfortable ranking\npeople's attractiveness oh yeah\nlike my parents would say i don't know\nwhat it's like to be shy that really\nhelped me a lot with my modeling career\noh you used to model i modeled for\nabout six years but now i'm a mother of\nfive\nand hey this is me now i love it okay\nokay really important caveat i want to\nstart off with she is a formal model\nwhich mind you\nwhat the industry wants in modeling is\nnot determined by what the model thinks\nthe industry wants it's determined by\nthe clients and the only people that\nreally know what the industry needs at\nthat given point in time are the owners\nof such modeling agencies i i got the\nprivilege to work with a few in sydney\nand\nwhat really happens is the owner of the\nagency or the manager or somebody up in\nthe managerial chain would give the\norders for what the client would need\nand um they'll try to sway what the\nclient wants so they'll do the client\nrelations and then the model would be\ngiven very direct instruction so in\nterms of assessing beauty in terms of\nassessing what the industry needs right\nnow asking a model is not\nthe best idea they really wouldn't know\num\nhow to rate someone's attractiveness\nthey will know how to make a living off\nyour looks which is what i'm guessing\nwe're going to see a lot more of here\nrather than how to rate someone's\nattractiveness so just keep this in mind\nthey're not the best people to ask\nwhat the industry needs or what looks\nare in fashion what looks and sell the\npeople that know that are the people who\nwork directly with clients which are\nusually the ceos or the\nthe upper management\nbring our first person in well hello\nthere\nhello you seem very confident i think\ni'm confident about the way i look the\nworld they will like you a little bit\nskinnier\nokay all right if your body shape\nmatches your height people would not see\nyour weight with your confidence and the\nway you look i'll give you okay so first\nthing i see here i i do agree what she's\nsaying is she's she's being a bit\nabrasive and uh people get very\nsensitive when they hear that they need\nto lose weight but i completely agree\nthat um this guy would look a lot better\nwith a bit less of a potbelly because he\nhas nice proportions he's got wide\nshoulders he's quite tall his um his\nfemale tibia ratios are quite balanced\nand his torso is uh not that long having\na shorter torso and longer legs seems to\nbe more preferred than the other way\naround if for both men and women but\nwhat i'm really noticing here is his\nposture uh notice how his his whole\nshoulders seem to like slump forward\nwhich is not not a great look honestly\nit's um it's kind of like they uh\nit's just having good posture is very\nimportant especially when you're tall um\nbecause it's it's all the more\nnoticeable it's like an amplifier\nother than the weight is there anything\nelse that i can improve on when you walk\nyour confidence let it come out when you\nwalk like oh well i don't know\npeople will see that that's great okay\nthank you\ni respect his maturity i mean he took\nthat advice based on i don't know about\nthe comment about his walk it seemed\nperfectly fine\nactually actually no i take that back\nlook at where he's looking right now in\nthe pause video it's looking down\num\nthat's a good catch by her she's i think\nshe's right about the walk actually now\nthat i changed my mind um\nyeah it's looking down and this actually\nreflects in the posture as well really\nimportant you saw how i mentioned the\npostures i slash forward and this is\nusually\ndue to a lack of having the right back\nmuscles which rounds out your shoulders\nforward so you can watch any\nfitness youtuber talk about this topic\nof rounded shoulders athlean x or\nwell i can't think of any other big\nfitness youtube at the moment but\nthey've talked about this issue a lot\nand so him getting a bit more\nmuscularity in his back would help round\nthe shoulders out backwards and it would\nmake it a lot less noticeable it would\nimprove his posture greatly and for him\nthat's i think much better advice than\njust simply losing weight\nhi hi how are you good how are you i am\nwonderful\nyou have a beautiful face thank you this\nsmile really helps but you should again\nmaybe i'm just being really pedantic\nhere first thing i noticed again is her\nposture rounded back um it's\nthere's nothing it's not too bad but\nideally you want to have straight\nposture not just for\nlooks reasons but also just for your\ngeneral health so you can see her back\nkind of contours that way and\nher her neck is just\nshe is looking downwards this way rather\nthan looking forwards that way\nso\nlooking downwards rather than eye level\ni think that's also a big influence here\nand her neck is pronated forwards\njust minor things but\nall of them are related to posture i\nthink posture is very important because\nit does change the way people perceive\nyou and there's research on that that we\ncan cover in a future video\nbut this is what's drawn my eye first\ndid not dress like your mother\ni would give you a six okay\nwhy am i giving you a six you may ask\nyes i would like to know you need to\nshow your figure because you have a\nbeautiful figure inside that big thing\nthank you okay take off the glasses let\nme see perfect better oh my god yes okay\nyou have a good figure you have a good\nface so\nand\ni think she has a lovely face and i\nthink six\nmaybe\num\nno i think she might should be closer to\na seven rather than a six\nwhen you think about it um\nthe idea of a six versus a seven or like\nfive i don't really like using the one\nto ten like system because it's very\ninaccurate and again there's research on\nthat but what really happens is we tend\nto think of the scale from one to ten in\nterms of percentages\nrather than in terms of percentiles so\nthere's a big difference here we tend to\nthink of it as like oh uh ten percent\nare in the one category ten percent and\nthe two category\nuh three four blah blah blah and you\nknow they're divided into 10 categories\nthat's how a lot of people interpret\nthis and that's how she's interpreting\nit she gave the other guy a seven she\ngave her a six and i presume she's going\nto give other people higher rankings as\nwell when in reality if i'm thinking\nabout this much more logically from a\nmodeling perspective you know my\nexperience in the industry\nwhat really happens is eights nines and\ntens\nuh more like the top five percent of the\npopulation maybe the top three percent\nkind of like how billionaires work with\nuh income distribution\nthe the top point zero zero one percent\nhave all the world and so in with looks\nthe top point zero zero one have all the\nlooks uh and it's not equally\ndistributed as we may tend to think so\ngiving her a six or a seven i think she\nmight actually be more towards a seven\nshe's got great features uh really\nbalanced uh\nreally balanced facial forward growth\nyou can see it from the side view here\nthe only issue is she like i mentioned\nshe pronates her neck forwards so i wish\ni had good drawing skills but i draw on\na green screen on an ipad it's very\ndifficult but her neck is\ngoing forwards right and this makes her\nmental cervical angle if i can draw this\nit's going to be very challenging this\nis the mental cervical so it's from the\nneck to the chin or the mandible body\nand this angle essentially\nis\nit makes you look like you have more\nsubmental fat so submental meaning the\nunder chin fat\nwhen your neck is pulled forward like\nthat rather than when you have good\nposture and you you know you sit there\nwith your head held high it makes your\njawline look a lot better so that's a\ntakeaway from this\nhands a little bit okay okay thank you\nokay thank you well hello there i'm\nnathan how are you doing oh good wow\nthat is good what are we here to do ah\nyou are here to\ncheck this out\nokay\nso i can see\nthat you\ntake care of yourself i would give you\na line and why why would you give me\nthat thing because when you came out of\nthat door i knew that you have the\nsparks that shows that you're very\nconfident it's good\nall right perfect\nokay so again i think nine is a bit too\nhigh\nuh he's definitely attractive and he's\ndefinitely confident in his features he\nknows he's found an aesthetic that works\nwell for him and this is something that\ni spoke about in the previous video on\nmen's fashion where a lot of men go\nthrough many different styles some like\nwearing suits some like wearing casual\nthe times i'm like we're dressing like\nharry styles once you eventually find an\naesthetic that works for you it looks\nyou you can carry yourself with pride\nalso his posture is very good here you\ncan see how straight he stands\nespecially with their hands held behind\nhim i guess it's kind of an optical\nillusion it straightens his back out\nmore than he normally would stand but\nregardless it's very good and this is\nwhat she means by confidence really\nshe's just talking about posture and she\nseems to correlate the two\ninterchangeably in terms of facial\naesthetics looks decent uh nothing\nremarkable but i guess it's just because\nhe's tall he\nand height really does matter when\nyou're trying to fashion clothes\ncorrectly some clothes are just designed\nwith a certain femur to tibia ratio in\nmind and\ndress pants a great example of this if\nyou've ever seen really short people\nwearing dress pants\nthey kind of tend to look squat and\nbecause the belt cuts off your mid\nsection\nwhere he's wearing two different colors\nhere right so it's color blocking\nit makes it very apparent where your\ntorso ends and your legs begin and this\nis working in his favor because he has\nlong legs and as i mentioned\nlong legs are attractive on both men and\nwomen it's preferred this is showing his\ntorso to be shorter and his legs to be\nlonger right so this um this optical\nillusion between his legs and his torso\nis working in his favor\ni know personally i really don't like\ntucking in my shirt i mean i just\nthought it was geeky or nerdy\nbut eventually i found an aesthetic that\nworked really well for me as i got older\nand so this is coming to something i do\ni'd wear really high waisted pants you\nknow something that go all the way up to\nhere maybe that's a bit too much but\nright so high-waisted pants you can\nexperiment with that there's plenty of\nfashion men's fashion um youtube videos\non how to style high-waisted pants so it\nmakes the legs look longer makes the\ntorso look uh makes your shoulders look\nwider actually that's just something\ni've noticed with high-waisted\nthere's you can also wear low-waisted if\nyou have shorter legs or really long\nlegs and shorter torsos you can balance\nit out and so the way you\ndelineate the belt buckle\ncan move up or down it doesn't\nnecessarily have to sit on the waist and\nthis is\nsomething he understands quite well\nyeah thank you appreciate it he popped\nthe good one\njoanna you seem nervous are you shy\ni guess i'm a little bit reserved i can\nokay really interesting this is exactly\nwhat i was talking about when shorter\npeople wear\npants it they look a lot more squat and\ni think with joanna here she would have\nlooked better if she want more high\nwaisted pants because her legs are very\nvery short especially the tibias they're\nthey're really short\nand so\nall of her body mass is distributed\nacross the legs especially with women\nthey tend to store more fat in the lower\npart of their body whereas for men they\nstore it more in the upper half so\nhaving longer legs on women is a huge\nbenefit to them because it essentially\nstretches their legs out and it's much\nmore evenly distributed whereas with\njoanna uh they're not as evenly\ndistributed and you can see in the\ncontour of her jeans uh there's it's not\na homogenous or something like a\nstraight or a curvy linear shape it's\nmore of a um\nit's uh well if i can draw it well never\nmind i won't draw it but it's more of a\nit's breaks up the evenness of her pant\nlegs a lot more harshly\nuntil you feel intimidated unfortunately\nwe'll give you a five oh okay first of\nall you need to change that glasses it\ndoesn't look very good on you should i\ntake my glasses off do you want to see\nthat you can take it off yeah would that\nmake it better when you took out the\nglasses i went to a seven\nokay looking at you you're not very tall\nhow has that affected your life people\neither see me as a child basically or\nthey don't give me like the respect that\ni think i should get you can be a\nfirecracker bring out that personality\nthat will make people not see your\nheight\nbut see who you are you know what i mean\nyeah i mean no disrespect to her but i\nthink that's rubbish advice\nyour personality doesn't just come out\nof nowhere it doesn't just come out of\nthin air it's developed through your\nphysical experiences with other people\nand so if people see you as being\nshorter especially look at how big the\nboots are i just noticed that her he's\ndoing really high heels uh if people see\nyou as being shorter then they're going\nto treat you as such and so no amount of\nbeing a firecracker or\nhaving an abrasive personality is going\nto really change their perception of you\nrather changing your physical aesthetics\nor wearing uh\nwearing a different set of clothes or\nstart\ni would recommend for\njoanna to wear less tight fitting\njeans essentially wearing less tight\nfitting clothes and um\nplaying around with where the waistband\nsits so if she\nwears more high waisted clothes then it\ncould change the contour of her legs and\nmake her legs look less squat\nessentially she her outfit um she's\ntrying to be more mature but\nyou can't overlook her physical\nproportions and i think rather than\ntrying to just wear the clothes and hope\nfor the best you should understand where\nthe shortcomings are why people are\ntreating you like a child and then work\nwork that out yourself right so reverse\nengineer that um if it's if they're\ntreating you like a child because you're\nshort then what can you do to look\ntaller not by wearing heels but by\nchanging the the silhouette of your body\ni think that's perfect\ni think you have very good smile thank\nyou you look clean\nwith your hair you're trying to stay\nyoung\nthe facial hair you try to look older\nthe combination kind of sets you off a\nlittle bit it's like conflict i\ncompletely agree with that i'm surprised\nyou said that that's that's exactly what\ni was going to say he has a very\nneotenous face and yatiness meaning\njuvenile and childlike if you haven't\nseen the video we've done on that uh\nwe've covered all the research on it but\nessentially men who have more juvenile\nfeatures uh and women too it's more of a\nbenefit to women less of a benefit to\nmen well there is they do neotenous face\nmen do tend to get a disproportionately\nhigher share of help from others so if\nthat's what you want then i guess having\na baby face is a good thing but for most\nmen that it tends to throw off the\nmasculinity tends to make them look more\nchildlike in juvenile as the name would\nimply and so he's grown out the beard\nhere which is\nit doesn't look bad i think he's quite a\ngood looking dude um he's not as tall as\nuh some of the other contenders we've\nseen but he does style himself well and\nthis is kind of what i was talking about\nwith um the whole idea of the silhouette\nso you can see he's wearing black on\nblack with the black jeans i think\nthey're jeans or chinos or whatever you\nwish to call them with black boots and\nso the silhouette of his legs are a lot\nmore seamless versus joanna who's\nwearing blue jeans with um dark\nhigh-heeled boots you can see exactly\nwhere her legs start and end and it\nmakes her look a lot more squat and\nshorter\nwith him he's wearing the uh waistband\nso his um where the so he's wearing his\npant legs a bit higher up and so this\ngives a bit more length on his legs um i\nwould like to do some performing but as\nof right now i work retail the majority\nof the work will say oh boy what is he\ntrying to sell look at that hair i think\nit looks good\nstay with performing\nand keep smiling\ni i\nquite like the hair i think um\nit's unique\nthe alternatives for him realistically\nhe either goes bald he has a buzz cut\nuh he grows the sides out\ni don't i don't think it would really\nmake much of a difference and the reason\ni say that actually\nif you can just see it in the corner\nbefore he leaves um\nhis forehead right here this forehead um\ncontour\nit's i'll just uh draw it here for you\nguys really quickly so say this is his\nhair and this is his forehead\nand these are his eyes nose and mouth\nright this this curvature of his\nforehead and this is something a lot of\nmen have\nit doesn't\nit this is one of the most neotenous\nfeatures that men have that makes them\nlook more childlike and this is exactly\nwhy she's coming up with this oh you\nhave a babyish face or whatnot it's this\ncurvature of the forehead right so with\nmore masculine men their their forehead\nslopes backward and we made a video on\nthis exact topic their forehead slopes\nbackwards and then their hairline starts\nso this straight angularity and say this\nis your eyes nose mouth what what not\nversus having a sloped forehead like\nthat\nthat makes a big difference right so the\nangular forehead but versus the babyish\nroundish forehead\nhairstyles are much harder to style on\nthe rounded forehead which is what he\nhas because it makes your hairline look\nmuch higher up than it is um my\nsuggestion would be to get a lower\nhairline through you know usage such as\nminoxidil or maybe even hairline\nreduction\nalthough\ni mean i can't really tell from this\npicture i don't think there's a whole\nlot that'll do him much good maybe\nhaving longer hair\ncould hide more of the forehead\nbut it's his facial features aren't to\nits benefit right so i think seven\ni think six is closer\nall right could you turn around a little\nbit\nhey\ni like your dress it looks very good on\nyou i can tell you have the eye lashes\ndone\ndoesn't really\ngive you\nthe ten\neight\nhow would i get a nine you're a natural\nbeauty person you need to enhance what\nyou have but not\nwait what natural beauty\nnatural beauty person\nshe's got makeup on though that's not\nhow it works\num\na i would not agree with i think\nno i definitely don't think eight's\neight is she started off with ten and\nthen she gave her a consolation eight\nshe's like i can't give you a ten\nbecause you then you know i'm just\nbs'ing you but i'll give you an eight\nout of consolation\nand um then she's like how can i get a\nnine\nuh\ni don't entirely agree with the advice\nshe's giving here\nshe has actually a very similar case of\nshort legs like the other lady and\nthe boots she's wearing um\nthey do blend in better with the contour\nof her legs and so it's a lot less\nnoticeable she also is a bit taller so\nagain the taller you are the more you\ncan get away with so it just does suck\nto be short in general uh her physical\nappearance\ni don't think there's much else to say\nthe black does complement her figure\nreally well\num it accentuates the parts that she\nwants to show and then hides the part so\nshe doesn't like the midsection versus\nthe uh her upper half so it the outfit's\nactually pretty good it's well put\ntogether add artificial to it do\nsomething about the nails i always have\nthem super long i can type with them i\ncan do hair with them wow okay if it\nworks for you it works for you thank you\ni would say six\npurple funky pants\nyes they are funkier right it doesn't go\ntogether\nshows me that you're very comfortable\nbut stay comfortable in your house\nokay\nand that definitely has to go so five\nwow\noh my god oh okay i'm sorry i'm a bit\ntaken aback too\nyou saw how surprised he got when he got\nthe five uh this is the type of guy that\ngets complimented on his looks all the\ntime he doesn't have a very uh feminine\nface and he understands that which is\nwhy he's growing the hair right and it\nsuits his face so this is what i talk\nabout when i say men go through a lot of\ndifferent aesthetics women too but women\ntend to\nintuitively know more about what works\nfor them and what doesn't compared to\nmen who i tend to think they need more\ntrial and error and this guy he knows\nwhat works for him he's not trying to be\nanything it's not he's not growing his\nbeard out he's not he understands that\nhis face is feminine he's got feminine\nfeatures\nbut he plays around that with the longer\nhair the uh shaved face the uh his dress\nchoices also\nand that's exactly what she's\ncriticizing which i think is very unfair\nso criticizing someone based on the\nclothes that they wear rather than their\nphysical attractiveness\nis\nis incorrect because he can just go home\nchange into something that'll impress\nher and then who gets a 10 right so\ndoes that actually help you improve in\nyour actual journey for looking better i\ndisagree right so\nclothes should be off limit\ndamn your insight is very good in some\nsituations but honestly like i don't\ngive a flying [ __ ] this is just like my\ndrip and i still love myself so\ni can tell\ni can tell\nyou\ntake ah man uh he is quite tall and uh\nthe\nthe baggy pants\nthey're actually his clothes are\nproportioned really well that's all i\nwant to say it's almost like a 50 50 um\nbetween his torso and his legs so\nproportion to me in terms of clothing\nis to proportion your physical features\nto accentuate the things you want and\nhide the things you don't so i think\nhe's done a good job just the color of\nthe pants might be a bit off-putting\nthat is good look at you\nlook at it you\nlook good\nthank you so you take good care of\nyourself i can tell i like the hair i\nlike the way that you portray\nwho you are that is very attractive\neight\nokay\nwhat you need to turn down what you\nwould suggest\nthat's what i need\ni already did okay\nwhat i don't get is people come onto the\nshow they know what's going to happen\nyet they still they just love arguing\nwith uh\nwith the person in charge i\nwhat is the point of coming on the show\nthen\nlet's say somebody goes to your site and\nsee what you do and want to meet with\nyou if you wanna\nshow that spunk of professionalism\nyou need to first try to take that out\nwell i'm telling you i only keep jobs\nthat let me keep my nose\nokay here's something that i just\nnoticed so remember at the beginning of\nthe video i told you she's a model\nand all of her recommendations i realize\nnow they\nthey're more geared towards professional\nuh employability rather than actual\nphysical aesthetics so this isn't a\njudgment of somebody's actual looks and\ni guess we've kind of established that\nalready but this is more of a judgment\nof how employable they seem and so all\nof her criterion you know with the\npurple funky pants she didn't understand\nthe quote-unquote drip she didn't\nunderstand uh her her nose ring\nthese are all things because as a model\nwhen the client wants a certain look\nyou have to perform what's known as\naesthetic labor and we've talked about\nthis um in some of the older videos\nwhere models have to change the way they\nlook to please the client basically\nright so you have to make some kind of\nsacrifice and black women\non average have to perform more\naesthetic labor than their white\ncounterparts\nsuch as changing their hairstyle you\nknow curling curling and damaging their\nhair or straightening it out\nand so\ni think this is where she's coming from\nthis attitude towards um\nto the towards this lady is essentially\nin terms of the aesthetic labor that\nsomebody\nlike her would have to perform to get a\nmodeling job right so being\nyou are i'm yourself\nmyself with what is in alignment with me\nokay and the the nails beautiful\nbut they're\ntoo long\nto work with you\nwell too\nnot just\nright so this is exactly what i said\nabout aesthetic labor you have to cut\nthe nails to work with her um you have\nto get rid of the nose ring to work with\nher so on right so this is the\nperspective that she's looking at it\nfrom it's me\ni\ntell it the way it is\ni try not to be too\ninsulting most of the advice all right\nso that's the video let's just quickly\ntake a look at the comments and i'll\ngive my final thoughts\ni guess they weren't prepared for how\ndirect she was going to be guy funky\npurple pants got wrecked see the thing\nis she's judging people based on their\non the things that they can change\nwhich is perfectly fine but it's not a\ntrue assessment of their looks right so\nif the question is formal model ranks\nstranger's attractiveness and\nattractiveness i\nassume is physical attractiveness then\nit's not a very good rating and they\nalways do this with all of cut and\njubilees videos the people in charge\nhave to\nfall under some kind of social norm so\nthey rate people based on what they\nthink the camera wants to see not what\nthey really think and so it's kind of\nsome sort of performative um\nperformative act right\nit's just that she's just playing into\nwhat people want\nshe's serving strong african auntie\nvibes which is why i knew she wouldn't\nhold back\nthe last girl got defensive because she\ndoesn't agree with piercings um\nnot because she got mad for her rating\nsure she got an 8 out of 10 anyway she's\njudging them how she was judged most\npeople who judge models aren't as\nattractive as the model but they know\nwhat sells what's interesting again and\ni use interesting a lot\nis people are criticizing the look of\nthe person judging as if you have to be\nsome kind of\nlook threshold to be judging other\npeople on their looks\nthat's that's ridiculous it's like you\nhave to be a food critic to know when\nfood is good or bad\nthere is a level of objectivity to\nreally anything in life any type of\nanything that's related to the art or\nanything that's related to beauty there\nis a level of objectivity and so\nshe's she's entirely correct in her\njudgment of how she's assessed these\npeople\nbut she's leaving out that she's looking\nat this from a model perspective she's\nlooking at this from a person who's\nemployed in a modeling agency versus the\nperson who employs people in a modeling\nagency so big difference there one knows\nwhat the client would want the other\nknows what\nin season right so sometimes\nhaving those rings may just be in season\nright having\nbeing a black african model may just be\nin season sometimes it might not be so\nno amount of changing what you look like\nis going to change that if you're not in\nseason\nthe guy with funky pants took what she\nsaid completely wrong when she said stay\ncomfortable at your house she didn't\nmean you should have stayed home looking\nlike that she was saying that the pants\nlook comfy but when he leaves the house\nhe should dress accordingly so funky\npants was another great example of how\nshe's looking at people's attractiveness\nshe's looking at it from a\nuh more of more of a client base\nperspective so you know if you're going\ninto a modeling photo shoot and going\ninto a casting call dressed like that\nyou're not gonna get the job which is\nentirely true but i don't think it's a\ngood\nassessment of somebody's physical beauty\nall right so if you've enjoyed the video\nleave a like comment

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Video Title: Influencers Are Editing Their Head Sizes Now | Instagram Vs Reality Ep. 22"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "﻿*Welcome back to Instagram vs. Reality, the \nsegment on the channel where we call out bad  \nphotoshop practices and impossible \nbeauty standards with science,  \nor just basic common sense, really. \nAs always, these videos are intended to be  \ninformative and are not aimed to target \nor slander anyone’s brand. This week’s  \nsubmissions are from r/instagramreality. \nLet's jump into our first example which is another  \n“professional” photoshoot and you can see that by \nlooking at the attire, the background, etc... At  \nfirst it might look like she has a double-jointed \nelbow, but if you look closely in the reflection,  \nthe arm is quite straight. So clearly, they have \nused the liquify tool to bring her waist in. This  \nis another one of those gratuitous edits that \nare not really required because you don't see the  \nshape of her body in that pose because her arm is \nhiding most of it so there's no need to slim your  \nwaist down or bring your hips out because even \nif you did have a thinner waist and wider hips,  \nyou couldn't see it in that pose anyway. \nTo fix it, we're going to use the same old liquify  \ntool to bring her arm back to its normal position \nand as we compare the before and the after,  \nwe can see the huge difference \nthat little change made.\n \nMoving on to the next picture we have another one \nof those textureless, no variation in the skin  \ncolor kind-of-picture and you might \nargue that it’s just good makeup. Well,  \nfirst makeup doesn't do that. It doesn't hide \nyour features as you can see in this picture.  \nEven though she has a lot of makeup on, you \ncan still see the skin texture, the shadows  \nand highlights on the skin and the \nsmall hairs. Her eyes look lively and  \nless flat. Whereas in this case, none of those \nthings are present. There is a harsh vermilion  \nborder and this is a result of a layer mask in \nPhotoshop. They probably masked her lips out with  \na small amount of feathering and then they started \nediting her face, flattening everything out. This  \ncould also be a Snapchat filter because that’s \nhow you get those long curved eyelashes. All of  \nthis is very apparent because her face colour \ndoes not match her shoulders and neck at all. \n \nSo to fix this one, we're going to use the same \ntechnique we've been using (to save time and also  \nproduce a somewhat believable result) which is \napplying a Sandstone texture on a gray layer,  \nchanging the blending mode to Overlay and \nremoving it from the parts we don’t need.  \nTo go a little bit further to add more variation, \nwe're gonna paint some freckles on her face,  \nblur the layer a little bit, and drop the opacity \ndown. Then finally, to introduce a little more  \ncolor variation, we’re gonna paint some colours \non a new layer and change the blending mode to  \nsoft light or color, bring the opacity down and \nthe final result is looking much better than  \nthe original. If we want, we could take it even \nfurther by taking the texture from our example  \nimage and applying it on this one. So we copy \nit from the cheek in our example and paste it  \nonto this picture, drop the opacity down and match \nthe colors using a Hue/Saturation layer and that's  \nit. You can see the skin looks more real \nthan before because there's more pronounced  \nhighlights on her cheeks and nose because \nthat is what the filter does, it flattens  \nout all of the colors and the highlights which \nresults in the picture appearing to be flat. \n \nFlat, here means that by looking at the picture, \nyou cannot tell if there’s any depth to it or not.  \nIn pictures or sketches, shadows and highlights \ndetermine the depth of an object or form.\n \nThe third example we have is yet again a \ncase of that strange trend where people,  \nfor some reason, like to have big heads which is \nweird because there's another trend where people  \nlike to have smaller heads, that you're \ngoing to see in our next example. Here,  \nwe are ignoring the plastic skin because there's \na bigger issue at hand of, well, a big head.  \nTo remedy the skin texture, we would use the \nsame process of adding Sandstone to a grey  \nlayer and masking out the parts that we don't \nneed or copying the texture from a different  \npicture and applying it here. The only upside \nhere is that the highlights aren't flattened out.  \nThere's no filter applied, it’s been done \nmanually where they have smoothened her skin  \nbut kept the highlights untouched. \nTo fix this one, we're gonna copy the head,  \nuse the content aware fill tool to fill the pixels \nbehind her head, decrease the size and use the  \nclone stamp tool to fix the irregularities and the \nfinal result looks more natural than the original,  \ngiven that you ignore the lack of \nany skin texture whatsoever.\n \nThe next example is the exact same one where \nthe edit was done by a “professional”, since  \nthis is from a TV show where they've made Taraji \nP. Henson’s head insanely larger than her body.  \nSince the background here is kind of \nmessy, it's going to take a lot of time to  \nfine-tune this picture. This was another \nexample of how many ridiculous edits  \nactually go unchecked and get posted \non social media, TV or magazines.\n \nMoving on to the next picture, it’s an example \nof the opposite trend that I was talking about  \nwhere people shrink their heads which we’ve \ntalked about in one of our previous episodes.\n \nTo fix this one, we're going to do the \nopposite of what we did in our last example  \ni.e select the head, duplicate it onto a new layer \nand then increase the size until it looks somewhat  \nbelievable or realistic. As you can see between \nthe before and the after, there’s not that much  \nof a difference but it still is a huge change \nand helps in making it look more natural.\n \nThe next example we have is of another liquify \nedit, although not a bad one but still not a  \ngood one either. One can argue that this is not \nunrealistic at all or it hasn’t been edited, and I  \nwould agree that this is not unrealistic but very \nrealistic, but the problem here are two things:\n \nOne is the reflection in the glass \nbehind her. (You can see that it's  \nnot as curved as she would have us believe)\nAnd the second is that her body is perfectly  \ncurved. (Which is indicative of \nthe liquify tool being used)\n \nNow, you can have such a smoothly curved \nfigure if you're wearing a corset,  \nbut since she’s wearing a very tight dress \nand you don’t see any outlines of the seams.\n \nTo fix this one, we are again using the \nliquify tool to match her body with that  \nof the reflection. As is the case always with \nedits like these, the before and the after are  \nnot that different yet still, they \nfelt the need to edit the picture.\n \n“Not all ethnic minority women rejected or \nresisted the slender body image. Some women  \ndesired the slender body ideal because they viewed \nit as a vehicle for increased social acceptance  \nand mobility. For many of the women trying to \n“fit in” to Ameri can society, the slender body  \nhad currency. Women who felt alienated from their \npeer groups, communities, and American society  \nmore generally talked about how being skinny \noffered them an improved sense of belonging.”\n \nThis is an excerpt from the “Most Girls Want to be \nSkinny”: Body (Dis)Satisfaction Among Ethnically  \nDiverse Women study done by Ann. M Cheney, \na PhD scholar in Anthropology.\n \nMoving on to the next one, we have Adobe gains \nmaking a return after some time. Since this  \npicture is too destroyed to attempt any fixes and \nany fixes that we try to make are going to make  \nit look even more weird,we are going to focus \non the signs. His jaw, biceps, his shoulders,  \nthe liquidy door, the rubbery walls and so on. \nIt's one of those examples where everybody knows  \nwhat they’ve done, yet they still post it \nand some people actually believe it. \n \nMoving on to the next picture, we have a baggy \nsweater which isn’t acting like one. It's not  \nsupposed to bend and follow the contours \nof your body. Judging by the setting,  \nthe lighting etc, this is another professional \nedit. Maybe a showcase for the boots or the  \nsweater itself. Another thing that stands out is \nthat the background is undisturbed which means  \nthat they had a pretty good selection \nof the subject so they could work on the  \nsubject alone without affecting the background \nor they had a clean plate of the background. \n \nA clean plate is a picture or a video taken \nfrom the same spot, with the same lighting  \nwithout your subject present in it.\nTo fix this one we are going to use, you  \nguessed it, the liquify tool. Since we are moving \nthe pixels to an extreme end, we are getting the  \ncharacteristic blur zones that we always \nmention come with the use of excessive liquify,  \nwhich obviously is the case here. There are some \nremedies against that but that is a lot of work  \nto be shown here. Anyway it looks better than it \ndid before because this is how a baggy sweater  \nshould look like. It looks more natural now and \nstill the editor decided to edit that one little  \nthing and make it so much worse. \nThe next picture is kind of subtle,  \nbut at the same time, not too subtle, because \nby looking at it at this size or zoomed out,  \neverything looks okay, but as soon as you zoom in \nyou see the net behind her has been clone stamped  \nover and over again for some reason. Half her \nelbows and half her hip is too. So it undoubtedly  \nhas been photoshopped, but you wouldn't have \nnoticed that unless you had zoomed in. \n \nTo fix this one we're going to use the clone stamp \ntool to copy parts of her elbow and we're going to  \ncopy her shorts from the other side and paste it \nhere and then match the lighting by using a levels  \nadjustment layer and as soon as you zoom out \nyou can see how much of a difference that made.\n \nWhen you look at the before and the after, you \nquestion yourself, how did I not see that before?\n \nSo these are the pictures that make you question \nall the other pictures that you see on the  \ninternet of having a fit body or basically \nanything because people not only photoshop  \ntheir bodies but their dresses and other things \nthat we are going to show in the next episode.\n \nAlright, that brings another episode to a close. \nHopefully you learnt something about Photoshop  \ntechniques. We’ve covered everything here in a \nprevious video somewhere along in the series.  \n \nAs always, if you’re enjoying the \ncontent, then you can really support  \nthe channel by subscribing and click the \nnotification bell to catch future episodes."}]}

Attractiveness"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hello and welcome so today i'm very\nexcited to be doing this\nfinally go around to it we're looking at\nranking men by attractness uh the\njubilee version\nand essentially i'm just gonna be giving\nmy review of it my\naesthetic knowledge i really wish i\nprepared my introductions a bit better i\nhate doing these reaction videos because\ni don't know what to say\num but so i have to think of everything\non top\njust off the top of my head but\ngenerally it's going to go fine\nall right let's begin fun fact i used to\nlive in texas\nuh but i didn't like it i'm jorge i'm\npursuing a degree in kinesiology\ni'm anthony i made like youtube videos\nthat work out stuff like that\nsam i'm studying astrophysics and\ni'm an air force cadet i'm roy i'm a\nrecent college graduate\nstudying political science well she okay\nso\njust before the video goes on any\nfurther i want to give out my\num my predictions of who i think would\nprobably\nget ranked the most at least attractive\nso firstly\njorge i think um he's doing well for\nhimself\nhe's got rounded shoulders uh it's quite\nbroad\ngenerally his face is mostly\nproportionate quite masculine\nbut in terms of these five men the thing\nthat i'd be looking for firstly is their\nhairline\none of the things that a lot of men\nneglect is\nthe essentially how the hairline frames\nthe face and if it's not\ncongruent to how your face looks so your\nlevel of facial masculinity\nit's it just throws off the whole facial\nattractiveness\na good example is sam so sam\nthe aerospace dude aeronautical i think\nwhatever um generally his hairline is\nquite\nsharp and uh he has a decent amount of\nfronto temporal\nrecession so essentially this little\nyou know triangle thing you see the\ntriangle near his temples\nthat type of recession is generally a\nmaturing feature you see that on men as\nthey get older\nbecause it's a sign of male pattern hair\nloss now\ni don't know about you but most men\ndon't want male pattern hair loss it's\na masculinizing yet maturing feature and\nso if your\nfacial features are quite nice if\nthey're quite juvenile if you look like\na child\num no disrespect to roy but he's a good\nexample of very juvenile features\nuh look at his hairline just for\ninstance absolutely zero\ntemporal recession just from here to\nhere and for that reason\nit gives this face a very boyish very\ncharming yet young look\nand so that's kind of what you'd want if\nyou facial masculinity is quite low you\nwould want\nto look like i don't know like a\nhandsome k-pop star they're very good\nexamples of\nfaces with lots of feminized features\nbut also with\na very juvenile hairline so the hairline\nto the\nfacial feature relationship is actually\nvery important and that's the first\ncriteria i've been looking at if i was\nassessing these men from like a more\nobjective standpoint obviously it sounds\nvery technical\nin reality i think most people do this\nquite subconsciously\nuh because you try to assess their face\nas a whole more of a holistic\ninterpretation\nbut if i were to break it down that's\nwhat i'd be looking at so that's the\nfirst thing\nand have you guys seen his eyes what\nyeah look at him\nbecause you got blue eyes i like his\neyes he got shiny eggs\nhe's probably the most fit yeah\noh you know he loved him walking up to\nthe front i get a lot of compliments\nand even though i don't really take\ncompliments well i guess there's been\nenough evidence to where i know all\nright he's a pretty good looking guy so\nanthony start him off very masculine\nfeatures just look at his jaw width\nso if i could draw that correctly\nessentially from\none corner to the other the jaw width is\nvery strong and\nthis is one of the reasons why he can\npull off the buzz cut look so well\nagain going back to that feature i\ntalked about temple recession so front\nof temple recession\nif i can draw his hairline you can see\nthe\nhis temples go back quite far and it's\ngenerally\nnot a big deal if you have very\nmasculine features so\nlike a type of one to one congruence so\nif i were to draw a\nline here down to his jaw well a\nstraight\nline that's the best i could draw on my\nipad if i were to draw a one-to-one line\nlike that\nyou can see that his face is basically a\nrectangle and for that reason it's very\nmasculine it's very strong\nand he can pull it off he can pull off\nhaving a shaved head\nalso his head is quite proportionate\nit's not doesn't have a very defined\nsagittal crest or it's not unshapely\nit's it's just\nbasically the ideal shape for a uh\na shaved look so you can pull off being\nbald you can pull a shaved look anything\nlike that\nit's just very shapely if you want more\ntips on that you can look at our video\non\nuh skull shapes i believe that that one\nwas\nbasically explaining all the different\nconcepts and the morphologies that would\ninfluence how a man's head or a woman's\nhead would look\nif it was shaved now another thing i'd\nbe talking about in\nanthony's uh defense is his eyes they're\nquite masculine they're again\nquite short and narrow and for that\nreason again the whole\nof his aesthetic the whole of his look\nis very congruent to\nhim as a person he's very uh he's quite\na masculine dude he's got wide shoulders\nhe's quite built he obviously goes to\nthe gym\nand so that type of congruency is what\npeople find attractive\nnow realistically just keeping it real\nhis biggest downfall would be that is\nshort he is\nthere was a very deliberate reason why\njubilee picked these five\ncharacters oh shoot i guess first of all\nright off the bat\ni think i don't know you can see\njubilee just think of it like this\njubilee is a talent agency they've got a\nlot of people\nsubmitting their some applications to\ncome in for a video and they probably\npaid them well\nso if i were to guess a talent agency of\nthis size would probably or media\ncompany realistically would probably get\naround 80 applicants for every video and\nso they'll choose 5 out of those 80 or\nmaybe 10\nincluding the girls as well to you know\nparticipate for a video\nthat being said there's a very\ndeliberate reason why they chose uh\none guy who's realistically less\nattractive one guy who's\nrealistically more attractive\nrealistically shorter realistically\ntaller this is a very\ndeliberate reason you see this a lot\nwith casting directors who want to\nportray some kind of\naudience emotion there's a very specific\nreason for why\nthis guy is you know put in the middle\nand he starts off in the middle and\nthere's a specific reason for why he's\nshorter but if if everyone was the exact\nsame height and they looked very similar\nthey're all white men all white men of\nsix foot two\nsize and the same build there would be\nno video there would be no\nnothing to compare against each other so\ni think it's a very\ni think it's a good i think it's a good\ntype of a good example of typecasting\nbut for that reason it does help in this\nman's defense\nbeing shorter it's not that big of a\ndeal as you see in a second\nit doesn't really affect his\nattractiveness that a whole much and i\ndefinitely agree with the rating that\nsome of the women give him that being\nsaid let's move over to the front\nand have you guys seen his eyes what\ni would personally put myself a four or\nfive\nyeah i'd say four or five i think you\nguys should duke it out and just say\nwhat you're a three i feel like i'm tall\nenough\ni'm the shortest guy bro\ni thought he was gonna be number one to\nbe honest so for me he\nat least has to be a three or two i i\ndon't want to be like\nrude or blunt but he kind of looks like\na frat boy so\ni think he should be like a three can i\nput a word in for myself that i'm not a\nbad boy\nwhat is it like i mean that's right i\ndisagree i think you're up there\npersonally i'm content with being four\nfour or five\ni stood at five you're a pretty good\nlooking guy\ni think you're pretty cute too roy i\nthink i'm a pretty attractive person\noverall\nbut seeing them and learning more about\ntheir personalities\ni wasn't going to argue that they're\nleast attractive than me\ni personally feel that you should rank\nhigher yeah i feel like you should be\ntwo or three if you guys i don't know\nthe cameras can pick it up i woke up\nwith\nblemishes today i got a crooked nose i\nbroke it a few years ago man\ni've always had problems with it i just\nlove how all the guys are trying\nall the guys all the men are trying to\nexplain why they should be lower\nwhereas if you watch the video for the\nwomen they're all trying to explain why\nthey should be higher yeah that seems\nlike a big deal to you but none of us\nlike even notice that you gotta be too\nthough\ni just no no because you're bigger like\nyou can't even tell man\nno i'm going to tell you guys\nhere we go\ni got tattoos too all right let me\ni don't know maybe i have a thing for\nwhite boys\nfrom my opinion and from my experience\nhe would be like higher on the\nthe ranking i think he's number two we\njust say\none two three\n[Music]\nthat's true dude he put some more look\nat look at his you got the beanie\nand he's got we forgot about the jeans\noh yeah that's like plus points\nyou still gotta have more like yeah more\nappearance yeah i wish that was a little\nbit bigger\na little a little bit stronger okay so\nwe're like this guy's a tool i think\nit's basically just them switch\nwhere would you put me what happened\nyeah right here at school okay\ni still think they're wrong and i should\nbe like here that's cause you're humble\nokay so here's my guess my guess is roy\nhe's he's got a stale number five um sam\nsam would probably go maybe number two\nif i had to guess uh jorge would go\nnumber one\nuh anthony would go\nnumber three or four it'd be a toss-up\nbetween\nanthony and jeremy who would either go\nthree or four\nso it's it's hard to say but definitely\njorge would be number one and roy would\nbe number five\nas harsh as that sounds you see in a\nsecond why i said that\nwe noticed once we took the jacket off\nhe moved up a couple spots\ni don't want to take out peer pressure\nto take off that jacket i remember i\nlike this stuff\ni think this is very solid cool good\nthose earbuds cannot stop anything\nthat's\nit's not gonna work\n[Music]\nwhen i saw when the guys were ranking\neach other\nit's like a first impression type of\nthing so basing off\nhow you look and the conversation that\nwe heard for a little\ntime i need to see their booties\nnothing nothing nothing nothing okay all\nright\nwe need to get the tender little\nsweetheart that is that is wrong right\nnow and\ni have to call this out i have to call\nthis out this is this makes me really\nupset\nthe the way that women talk about roy in\nthis video\nit's very it's very pitying and it's\nvery\num condescending i feel because\nroy he granted he's not the best looking\nguy there's a very specific reason like\ni said that jubilee cast him\nin this position and the fact that the\nmen put him at the bottom\nmeans that essentially the way that the\nwomen\nare rating the men as you see again in a\nsecond is that\nit's dependent on who they think can\nactually take the\nrating that they're given with so like\nwho's most likely to go home and cry and\nwho's least likely to go home and cry\nabout their raiding\nuh and for that reason they pity roy for\nbeing\nlost yet they still put him at the end\nit just doesn't seem fair to me\ngive you flowers like and go to your\ndoorstep by far if i was sick i'd call\nhim to take care of him that's it like\nflat out oh roy's a sweetheart\noh i love him i wanted him to talk more\ni felt like all the boys talked over\npoor roy\nhonestly i love little baby roy look if\ni\nas a guy i don't i wouldn't want to be\ncalled little baby roy that's all i'm\nsaying\ni would not want to be referred to as\nlittle baby roy who needs protection\nfrom everyone else\nand i want to be ranked fourth out of\nfifth you know just to make me feel\nbetter i wouldn't take the pity points\nit's just\nit's frankly quite disrespectful just\nkind of shoved in the back of the line\nevery single time and i was like this\npoor kid\nattractiveness for me and it isn't just\ndo you see how they told you about roy\nyeah we were done after this went to be\nlike\nwhy don't you go grab coffee my number\none would be spill a tea kalin\nhe looks like a bootleg michael b jordan\nso he would go first because we love\nmichael b\njordan but astrophysics yeah\nhe has a nice haircut like his eyes i\nfelt like i had\na very friendly vibe from him just his\nlike eyes and his smile\ni thought sam was the most attractive to\nme he wasn't\nstriving to be number one he was just\nlike place me where i am\nand i'll take that i feel like he's\nfriends with his mom\nbut i feel like he also might like cheat\non you\nno yeah let's try to think of something\ndrastic here\nbe\nokay so here's my problem with how they\nactually made this video\nthe way the women are writing them in\nwhich is perfectly fine it's\na combination of physical attractiveness\nand emotional connection which is\nunderstandable because\nit's a comparison of the male gaze which\nis purely physical versus the\nfemale gaze which is more emotional\nbased so generally ask yourself out of\nthe five men\nwhich one would be able to elicit the\ngreatest emotional response\nwhich is kind of why women you know\nthere's a trope of nice girls\nnice guys versus bad boys\ni don't know i think it's just a stupid\nthing just in general but\nthe idea goes that generally women\nprefer bad men\nand one of the reasons for that is\nbecause when you look at it from a\nfemale guest perspective\nit makes sense because bad men can\nelicit greater emotional responses\nthey're\nmore they're just fun in general and who\ndoesn't want to have fun\nso in that comparison he probably has a\nbad temper\nhe punches i don't like how they're\nprojecting\nlike he probably has a bad temper oh\nhe's a trump supporter he looks like\nhe'll treat you well and take you out to\ndates that's that's not really fair\nthat's not a very good assessment\ndrywall when he gets angry caitlyn gave\nher one who's your two three four five\nit was one two three four five\none two three four\n[Laughter]\nfour five just because i'm very big on\nheight i would go\none two\nthree four five hey\nshe get she gave the short guy\nimmediately i like the guy in the green\nshirt who was shorter\nmade eye contact and i was like okay\ncool like i think that's attractive is\nlike connection\none two three four five yay\nokay we're on the same i like the\ndisparity i do i do enjoy\nseeing the disparity between the two\nwomen's ratings so firstly\nthey gave anthony ranked number one and\nthen\nin the second version they gave anthony\nranked number four\nwith the other girl so it does show\nthat height isn't as big of a deal as\nyou know you'd think it is important but\nanthony does carry himself very well so\nthere is a very good anecdotal point\nthere\nthat um it's not as important that being\nsaid\nuh you have to remember that the women\nhere who are raiding\nare going in front of a camera so\nthey're not going to give you their true\nfeelings because\neven if it was me even if it was a guy\neven in the video with the guys raiding\nthe women\nthey didn't give their honest at least i\nfelt that way they didn't give the most\nhonest opinion of\nwhat they really thought because you\nknow we're always subject to\nsocial conditioning and so you know you\nmay say that anthony's number one you\nmay really prefer him but\nwhen push comes to shove you may\ncoincidentally always\num be find yourself attracted to blue\neyed\num blue eyed blondie sam over here so\ni i would take that one with the grain\nof salt three four\nfive yay okay we're on the same boat i\nmean i feel like i like a guy who's not\nso skinny just because i like you know\nprotection\ni don't want to break them i really like\nhis eyes\nokay he's for sure one yeah you gotta\ncome right here\nthe blue it's like who\nme i think yeah yeah or two or three see\ni think jorge\nactually no jorge jorge jorge\nhow dare you be adorable i don't really\nlike\nanybody's outfits today i understand\nwe're all comfortable\ni don't know i think dressing is\nimportant granted that the outfits\naren't the best\ni mean they just look like regular dudes\nnothing special but\nthat's also not a fair way of assessing\nany of the men because\nthat's not something you can really\njudge based on\nlike they can easily change into a suit\nif that's what you prefer they can\neasily change into something else if\nthat's what you prefer\nso it's not really a very fair track\nfair termination of attractiveness\nbecause they're coming in for a studio\nshoot they probably didn't get\ninstructions\noh come in in a suit you know that's not\nwhat a normal person would do they come\nin whatever they find comfortable\nagain that's not something i would\nconsider as a very objective way of\nmeasuring attractiveness but\nthat's just me that's just me yeah\nthat's fair\ncan't make me picture them naked that's\nweird\npink shirt would go in seconds i just\nlove the physical they're so visibly\nuncomfortable at that comment i want to\npicture them naked that is\ncan you imagine the double standards\nthere that's not fair i don't like that\nand then everyone would scooch is\neveryone like that let's see\nyeah let's do it okay right over there\nyeah yeah yeah\ni would just like to say what a little\nangel right what a little\nangel get somewhere not inside\nlook at his little wings protect him i\ncare more about\nthose oh man how do i explain it\nthese comments are so condescending what\na little angel look at his little wings\nhe should be anywhere but five really\nokay then where should he be\nfour number four what the girls thought\nthan the guys\nbut that's just my own opinion wait so\ncan he just move up because i\nhe can't be there yeah can we put him in\nthird third these are\ni kind of feel like maybe they should\nswim yeah\ni am 100 okay with this lineup i feel\nlike i'm okay with this whatever\nokay here's here's my issue with it this\nis how i think they\nactually rated the men who can take\nthe rating that they're given without\ngetting upset\nthe way they talked about uh roy was\nvery degrading it was very condescending\nand\nquite frankly i found it quite rude the\nthe idea is basically\nthey feel like that roy wouldn't be able\nto take being ranked the least\nat least attract number five because for\na number of reasons he just looks like a\nchild\nright let's just be frank he has very\njuvenile features\nand for lack of a better term he has\nvery feminized features\nfor that reason they felt like he needs\nneeds to be protected quote unquote\nand so they protected him by moving him\nfrom\nfifth place to fourth that doesn't seem\nlike a very\ngood um well hopefully roy didn't\nrealize what happened but\nif it was me that i would take offense\nto that because that's\nit's i would much rather be number five\nwhere i should be\nrather than being pushed number four out\nof pity\nbut that's just me now with uh\ni believe his name was jeremy with\njeremy um essentially they just put him\nin five because he\nhe looks the most like a grown man to be\nfair so they felt like he could take it\nwhereas if he compared the results\nbetween the other women\njeremy was in the top three so he was in\nthe top three for a number of times\nand then right at the end they just felt\nlike putting him at number five because\nwhere else who else could you put at\nnumber five that would\ngenerally not you know like without\nhurting anyone's feelings you gotta put\nsomebody in number five so\njeremy is in number five just by\ncircumstance not necessarily because\nhe's less attractive than any of the\nother men\ngranted i actually think he's more\nattractive obviously if i would to have\nit\nif i would suggest something probably\nsuggest that's what being\nroy and jeremy out obviously that's\ni mean like i'm saying i'd roy's it\nseems like a great\ndude but it's not a very fair rating and\nthere's a lot of\npity right and i hate that i hate that\nconcept\ni felt like we did a pretty fair job\nmost of us came to a consensus on it\nit did definitely feel a little\ndegrading and a little uncomfortable\ndon't get me wrong\ni don't want to be mean but i didn't\nfind any of them attractive so it was\nkind of a lot harder than i anticipated\noutside of this i would not have looked\nat any of the guys\ni would walk past each one of them but\nbeing in the same room and seeing this\ndon't find any one of these men\nattractive that kind of makes sense\nbecause um\nif you look at the dating statistics\ngenerally\nthese men except for hawaii like i'm\nsaying hawaii is very attractive i think\nhe has a lot going for him and uh if\nanything he should be number one\nand so if you look at the dating\nstatistics generally women do tend to\nprefer men who are above average and\nquite frankly speaking all of these men\nare average or around average like there\nthere's a very deliberate reason like i\nsaid why jubilee chose\nthis specific like the most specific\ngroup of men possible\nbecause they all come from different\nbackgrounds and sizes and body builds\nbut they're all more or less average\nexcept for maybe like the top two i\nguess they'll be like it's slightly\nabove average\nor somewhere around that and i suppose\nroy would be slightly below average\nagain i'm just keeping it real don't\ncancel me for saying\nwhat we're all thinking i'll we'll go to\nthe comment section in just a second\nbut that being said the fact that the\nwomen don't find any of them attractive\nisn't that surprising to me um just in\ngeneral but\nit's it's kind of it's kind of it kind\nof sucks\nuh if you're a guy watching this uh yeah\nbad luck\ni don't know improve your looks a lot\nharder than i anticipated\noutside of this i would not have looked\nat any of the guys\ni would walk past each one of them but\nbeing in the same room and seeing this\ntype of personalities that they have\nthese are some nice guys to be friends\nwith oh we are really different\ni think most of the girls are more\npersonality based\nwhich is good that being said they all\nseem wonderful honestly these are these\nare the homies like if i\nhad if i just met this random group i\nwould probably become friends\nthey all seem very nice and friendly and\nthey seem like genuine dudes\nthat being said that's not what we're\nrating men on the video is ranking men\nby attractiveness and\nas i gave you my reasons for it there's\na number of reasons why this is\ncompletely flawed\ni don't think it's very accurate and\npeople don't really want to acknowledge\nwhat's actually going on\nall right so let's look at the comments\nsee if they agree or disagree with what\ni'm saying\nbootleg michael b jordan ranks him fifth\nby the end i think they're talking about\njeremy and that's completely fair\nthat being as that being said um\nthat wasn't necessarily jeremy did get\nranked first by the guild that actually\nsaid\nbootleg michael b jordan so i don't\nentirely agree with that\ni'm sure the girls had good intention\nbut they sounded like they wanted to\nbreastfeed roy rather than date him\nwhich is exactly what i've been saying\nthese comments that they're making\ntowards roy are very condescending\nand like again bro roy is a grown man\nmaybe he's just less social than the\nothers\nthat doesn't make him a five-year-old i\nthink roy is actually cute i don't know\nwhy they were acting like they felt bad\nfor him\nexactly what i'm saying the way that the\nwomen were talking about\na man who is less attractive granted he\nis less attractive than the average and\nthere's a number of reasons for that we\ncan go over them if you really want\nbut for that reason they\nthe the comments were so unnecessary it\nwas quite\num the fact that they gave him points\nout of pity\nhas to be the greatest insult i could\nthink of\nand it's such a backhanded compliment\nagain men openly complimenting men is so\nwholesome\ni do agree the girls arguing with who's\nprettier the guys are hearing who's ugly\nthat is such that's what i said i don't\nlike anyone's outfit today\nthat's like i explained that's not a\nvery fair way to judge\nsomebody because you can just as easily\ngo home and change into whatever\nwould impress you if that's what it took\nthat's not what they're being judged on\ni think\nthey all did a great job on their\noutfits always literally so cute and my\nheart smelled to me and said you're cute\ntoo roy\nwas good looking and he just looks like\nhe lacks confidence and it's true\num he is very soft-spoken and in the\nvideo for being soft-spoken they\nall the other men spoke over him which\nis you know that's\nwhat happens in a group dynamic somebody\nwill get left behind\nbut the way that the women again felt\nlike they had to protect him it's\nit's just unnecessary the way the girls\ntreated roy makes me so angry i'd rather\nbe ranked five than patronized that's\nwhat i'm saying\nlet me leave a like on that that's what\ni'm saying i\nactually took the liberty of\nphotoshopping\nanthony to be a bit taller and um\nyeah i don't know if it actually makes a\nbig difference he's proportionately\ncompletely out of whack\num his torso and his his feet basically\nthere's there is no congruence there\ni've i haven't done the best job but i\njust wanted to point out\ndoes height really make a difference\nhere i know a lot of men are concerned\nabout being shorter than average\nbut i think anthony actually carried\nhimself well and he's a very good\nexample of\nyou know making as much of a difference\nas you think with men there are a lot of\ndifferent options like shoes that you\nknow generally give you a bit more\nheight there are elevator shoes that are\nvery sophisticatedly made and you know\nthey can help\nhide if that's what you need just to\ngive you a little bit of an inch\nor a boost that being said um\ni don't think it makes that big of a\ndifference as you would think he's still\nraided behind\nabove roy and jeremy although i don't\nthink that's\nyou know for a number of reasons i don't\nthink that's entirely correct\nbut in this case it doesn't really help\nit doesn't make him\nany more attractive and one of the\nreasons why i think\nthe proportions are wrong here is\nbecause his head shape is not\nin proportion with his uh body so\nyou know his head shape the width the\nactual width of his head should be a bit\nwider\nand i can probably correct that in\nphotoshop but it doesn't really make\nmuch of a difference\nall right so that's the end of the video\nif you've learned something well\nwhy don't we talk about what we've\nlearned what are we trying to recap\nbasically the gist of it is roy is\nnot unattractive he's just below average\nand part of that is because he has\nacne he has some asymmetries he has a\nnumber of he has a quite a weak jaw and\nit's quite feminized\nand his overall facial features are\nquite neotenous and the juvenile\ni mean generally that's why the women\nwere describing him as a little boy\nthey're describing as a kid i i would\nknow as a grown man i would not want to\nbe called a little boy or a kid\nbecause that's just so patronizing i i\nfeel bad for him i genuinely do\nand for those reasons he they felt that\nthey had to protect him\nby giving him points out of pity which i\nthought was very\nunnecessary it was it was just frankly\nquite rude\nbut granted the rest of the men are also\nnear around average maybe like a point\nor two above or below average\nbut granted they do quite well for\nthemselves like anthony he carries\nhimself quite well despite being shorter\nuh jorge it's definitely got an\nunconventional look he's not\nentirely if you look at his facial\nfeatures they're not entirely well\nbalanced\nhe's got a crooked nose as he pointed\nout himself his eyes are\na bit misshapen and a bit biased towards\nthe left\nbut that being said he does have very\nmasculine features like a strong jaw\nvery broad shoulders he's quite tall so\nthose things\nmask all of his other insecurities and\nhe does well for himself he's rated as\nmost attractive\nby the girls by the men and even by me\nso\ni definitely think he does well for\nhimself that being said i feel like\njeremy\nwas a victim of circumstance\nrealistically he was just put there\nbecause\nsomebody has to go at the end right and\nso who could i put at the end without\nfeeling like i'm actively making a\ndecision\nthe best way the way i'm thinking of it\nright now is\nif you've ever done the trolley problem\nwhere it's like would i want to\nintervene and save one person sorry save\nfive people or would i want to not\nintervene and let one person on the\ntrack\ndie right it's kind of the same thing\nwith a lot of\ncognitive psychology where people\ngenerally don't want to be\nthe reason for raiding somebody you know\nbeing\nless attractive so essentially they're\njust putting\neverybody in front of jeremy and pushing\nhim back but they're not saying\nexplicitly\njeremy you you deserve to be at the end\ndo you see how that's different you're\nnot\nyou don't feel as guilty because oh he's\njust there by circumstance he's\nrelatively less attractive\nit's not that i said he's unattractive\nvery big difference\nnow with that being said i don't think\nthat's a very fair assessment of jeremy\nhe just\ndefinitely deserves to be higher the\nwomen should have actually put roy\nat the end um obviously it's it's their\nchoice but i\nit was my choice i'd put roy at the end\nfor a number of reasons\nbut that being said it's very\npatronizing they feel like they had to\nprotect roy\nand so they gave him points out of pity\nand put jeremy there instead\nso i don't think it's a very good\nassessment of ranking men by\nattractiveness\nquote unquote\n[Music]\nyou"}]}

Intelligence? | The Hillary Effect"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Is there a link between facial attractiveness\nand intelligence?\nYour face is the first thing people notice\nabout you and it is what most people use to\nform their initial opinion of you.\nYour social status, educational level, or\ncareer choice doesn’t come into play during\nthis stage.\nOnce you speak to people, their opinion might\nchange but until that happens, your face is\nthe major determinant in deciding how people\nperceive you.\nFacial perception is especially important\nin social and personal settings as it can\naffect your relationships, often negatively\nif you are perceived to be close off and angry.\nApart from your general facial expressions,\nespecially in the resting phase, facial perception\nalso depends on your facial attractiveness\nlevels.\nGenerally speaking, attractive people are\nalmost always perceived to be more outgoing,\ncharming, and well-rounded people.\nThis is usually the reason for higher social\nrankings of attractive individuals.\nRecent studies have, however, shown that the\nsocial and professional success of attractive\nindividuals is strongly related to their perceived\nintelligence.\nThis means that attractive people are generally\nassumed to be smarter, which combined with\ntheir presumed positive personality traits,\ngives them an edge over unattractive people\nand results in them being more successful.\nBut the question remains; Are the presumed\nintelligence levels any close to the actual\nIQ levels?\nOr is it a giant misunderstanding?\nA study performed by a Czech scientist named\nKleisner in 2014 tried to answer this question\nand many more.\nFor the study, participants were shown pictures\nof 40 males and 40 females.\nThe participants were asked to then rate the\nsubjects’ intelligence.\nThe results of the study were quite interesting,\nto say the least.\nAnswering the main question, the leading author\nof the research found no connection between\nhigh assumed intelligence levels, high IQ\nlevels, and general facial attractiveness.\nMeaning that, although attractive people may\nbe perceived to be intelligent, it doesn’t\nmean that attractive people are more intelligent.\nThis, however, does not change the social\nnorms and attractive people continue to benefit\nfrom the illusion of higher perceived intelligence.\nAttractive people usually are more likely\nto get a job and even, be given a higher salary\nthan their unattractive counterparts solely\nbased on social perceptions and norms.\nHowever, there is a discrepancy when comparing\nthese benefits amongst both genders.\nWomen are usually perceived to be more intelligent\nif they are traditionally attractive, even\nmore so than an attractive man.\nThis may be due to the fact that women are\nusually more commonly and frequently judged\nbased on their appearance when compared to\na man.\nIt would make sense then to see more successful\nwomen with high-paying jobs than their male\ncounterparts but that is not the case.\nWhy is that?\nThe research also answers this question, in\ntwo parts.\nFirstly, most females were perceived to be\nintelligent based on their attractiveness\nand friendliness.\nHigh career motivations and strong work ethic\nare not seen as attractive features of a woman,\nhence reducing her to lower ranks of attractiveness.\nMoreover, dominant women are also perceived\nto be intimidating, abrasive, and too self-sufficient\nfor their good.\nThe overall lower ranking of attractiveness\ngiven to dominant females is what reduces\ntheir perceived intelligence and hence, their\nsocial and professional opportunities.\nThis effect is also termed the Hilary effect.\nSecondly, Kleisner found a stronger relation\nand similarity between perceived intelligence\nand actual intelligence in males than in females.\nThat may be due to the difference in criteria\nof perception for females versus males, as\nalready mentioned.\nMoreover, men benefit more from being honest\nabout their intelligence, in an evolutionary\nsense than females.\nAs discussed before, an intelligent woman\nmay appear intimidating and this may negatively\naffect her social and personal relations.\nHowever, a strong, attractive, and smart man\nacts as the poster boy for success.\nAlso, intelligent men have an evolutionary\nbenefit that women prefer them as mating partners\nand long-term partners to help raise the children.\nThis is because intelligence and attractiveness,\non the genetic level, is associated with healthy\ngenes which is what women prefer when choosing\na mating partner to produce an offspring with.\nKleisner’s research also found that there\nis a stereotypical facial structure that most\npeople with high perceived intelligence have.\nAccording to his research, the facial traits\nassociated with intelligence are a thin chin,\nlarge protruding nose, on a narrower than\nusual face.\nAn oval and broad face, on the other hand,\nis stereotypically associated with lower perceived\nintelligence.\nOverall, this research claims that pretty\npeople are considered to be smarter but aren’t\nactually as smart.\nHowever, men have a smaller gap between their\nperceived intelligence and actual intelligence\ncompare to the female population.\nThis proves that there isn’t a direct link\nbetween facial attractiveness and actual intelligence.\nBut it doesn’t change the fact that attractive\npeople are more likely to succeed due to their\nstrong social presence.\nHowever, Kleisner’s research still fails\nto answer why at all there is the presence\nof the stereotype that facial attractiveness\nand intelligence are related, positively.\nYes, there is no actual evidence supporting\nthe claim but there are two possible reasons\nas to why the stereotype exists.\nEvolutionary psychologists believe that the\npositive link between facial attractiveness\nand intelligence exists as a result of assumed\nhigh genetic quality.\nSimply put, attractiveness is the result of\nhealthy genes, as beauty is an indicator of\nhealth.\nAnd a healthy genetic makeup is required for\na person to be intelligent and smart, which\nis why a causal-effect relationship forms\nbetween the two traits of healthy genes.\nAlthough this is a great theory, it cannot\nbe proven, mainly because when the genetic\ncomponents are controlled and altered, the\nresults do not change.\nSo genetics cannot possibly have as big an\neffect as assumed by evolutionary psychologists.\nOr at least that is what current research\nsuggests, perhaps, further research into the\ntopic may yield different and better results.\nThe second possible, and more plausible reason\nfor the existence of this stereotype is assortative\nmating.\nAlthough Kleisner mentions mixed mating theory\nin his research, this is slightly different.\nWomen usually prefer a mate that can provide\nfor the offspring and themselves, which in\nsimple terms refers to an intelligent man.\nOr a more successful man.\nAccording to Kleisner’s research, an intelligent\nmale is also an attractive male.\nAdding these pieces of information together,\nwe get the result that women prefer to mate\nwith attractive and intelligent men.\nMen, however, prefer to mate with attractive\nwomen.\nAs proven by Kleisner’s research, attractiveness\nand perception of intelligence do not go hand\nin hand for women, so attractive women may\nnot be as intelligent a women as unattractive\nones.\nMoreover, the attractiveness of women is related\nmore to a good sense of humor than it is with\nintelligence.\nSimply put, men mate with women who make better\nsocial companions, and if anything, a higher\nsocial and professional status of a woman\nmay be off-putting to a man.\nAccording to the associative mating theory,\nif intelligent men mate with attractive women,\nand both, intelligence and attractiveness\nare heritable, the offsprings would be both\nsmart and attractive.\nThis is believed to have given rise to the\nstereotype but it is safe to say that, that\nis exactly what it is, a stereotype.\nNot a fact.\nHowever, it is important to remember that\nyour facial attractiveness does affect how\nyou are perceived and attractive people generally\ntend to be more successful, both socially\nand professionally, regardless of their \nintelligence levels."}]}

Look at this picture and tell us which  \none looks less real or which one incites the \nUncanny Valley effect. We'll pause for a few  \nseconds and let you comment down below. Now, \nif you thought both were real, you are wrong  \nand if you thought both were fake, well you're \nstill wrong. The one on the left is supposed to  \nbe real and the one on the right is trying to \nbe real. The right one is a computer generated  \ncharacter called Lil Miquela that was created \nback in 2016 but only rose to popularity from  \n2018. If you check both their Instagram profiles, \nthe CG character has 3 million followers and  \nthe \"supposedly real person\" has 5.3 million. \nWhich is not a huge difference and it highlights  \nthe priorities or the type of content, people \nare looking for. At this point people seem  \nto not care about reality but only the \naesthetics, if the aesthetics mean less  \nemotive faces with even less realistic features.\nYou can see in these pictures and in the pictures  \nfrom their Instagrams that the CG character \nis more expressive and emotive than this. Now,  \nthis picture has been edited in a lot of \nplaces like the smoothened skin texture,  \nperfect jawline and perfect makeup.\nShe is obviously wearing makeup which  \nshe later enhanced in Photoshop as you can see \nsome of the skin colour is seeping into her hair,  \nwhich can happen due to 2 reasons.\n* While applying the makeup she went a little too  \nfar which is highly unlikely since her YouTube \nchannel is dedicated to makeup and fashion.\n \n* Or She went too far in the digital makeup \nprocess. It happens if you're painting on the skin  \nwith a low opacity brush and you unintentionally \npaint a little bit over the hair too. \n \nWe're not even gonna talk about the vanishing \nforehead wrinkles or the missing smile lines  \nbut we will talk about how the folds under \nher lower eyelids suddenly just fade away.  \nThis is a screenshot of a video of her's and \nyou can see that she has more of a rounded jaw  \nthan the perfectly sharp jaw with a \npointy chin than what's shown here.\n \nIt's just sad to see that \npeople prefer this over this.\n \nNow let's talk about Lil Miquela for a while. \nThe only time you can really see that she's not  \nreal is when they put her with other people. \nEven though your brain is programmed to spot  \neven the smallest of inconsistencies and \nyou can spot a fake from a mile away. \n \nThat's why recreating human faces in VFX is such a \nchallenge. You can't animate the microexpressions,  \nthe subtle details that make our faces \nso expressive that we don't even have  \nto say a word to show what we're feeling. \nNow, in stills, you can fake it to look almost  \nreal but something always ticks you off and that's \nwhy you mostly see pictures of such edits and not  \nvideos. But the latest technology allows people \nto manipulate, even a live video, like this. \n \nMoving on to our next picture, we have another \nsimilar disaster of a textureless edit. This  \none is much cleaner and professional. The only \nthing that stands out is the skin texture and the  \ntexture you see is not her real skin texture. It's \njust some grain added to make it look like skin  \ntexture. It's like how we create the texture using \nthe sandstone texture from the filter gallery.\n \nIt works for our pictures because \nthe pictures that we use are of low  \nquality and they're already heavily edited \nso it's safe to assume that at that point,  \nthey're not really going for realism. In our \nlater example, we're going to briefly explain  \nhow to and how not to edit such pictures. \nMoving on to our next picture, let's talk about  \nthose impossible proportions where the waist is \nnot wide enough to hold all the organs. I'm only  \ngonna say one thing about this picture. That's one \nhell of an elastic on those pants. How it managed  \nto retain its shape after getting stretched \nso much to fit all that is just beyond me. \n \nNow, to fix this one, we're going again with our \nfriend and our foe, the liquify tool, to bring the  \nwaist and the hips back to a realistic position.\nNow if we compare the before and the after,  \nsuddenly, it looks completely \ndifferent yet completely normal.  \n \nThe next example is of a girl at an arcade with \nbutt so attractive that the guy's legs behind her  \nare following the shape of her butt. It's just \npointless to ask how people miss such obvious  \nthings but we've already said enough. So let's \ntalk about fixing that poor guy's legs, we're  \nagain going to use the same old liquify tool. \nAlready, you can see it looks so much better and  \nthe guy does not look like he's hiding \ntrue pain behind that smile. \n \nThe next picture is a similar one and this \nis one of those pictures where it's easy to  \nmess up the edit since the background is so \ncomplex. She's actually done a pretty good  \njob to hide it but as you can see next to her \nthigh, the pattern is curved and also behind\n \nher butt, the pattern is much more condensed \nthan it is in the rest of the places. So again,  \nthis one has obviously been edited and to \nfix this one we're again, you guessed it,  \ngoing with the liquify tool. Now, there's going to \nbe a lot of distortions in the background which is  \ngoing to cause those classic blur zones which is \nthe telltale sign that a picture has been edited.  \nBut we can fix those later using a new layer or \nduplicating the background layer onto a new one.  \nAfter just editing a little bit, you can \nalready see that this picture looks more  \nbelievable than before. Now it's not to say \nthat these proportions are not possible at all.  \nThere are always exceptions, but these \nare some rare cases where they can achieve  \nsuch proportions only after getting a lot \nof procedures done, getting some of their  \nribs taken out and stuff like that which is \nexpensive for the normal people to afford.\n \nMoving on to the next picture, we have Bella \nThorne with makeup on but without any excessive  \nediting and honestly, until today, I had no \nidea that she had so many moles on her face  \nbecause I've never seen her without those \nfilters on and today for the first time,  \nI saw how many moles she has on her face and \nI'm amazed by the fact that I've never actually  \nseen her real face. And you can see in this video \nwhich was posted on Reddit, that with this filter,  \nyou can get rid of some of the texture to make \nit look smooth but not too fake. You can still  \nsee the makeup but not the texture. In this \npicture, you can see some skin texture and none  \nof the little blemishes. Her makeup is perfect, \nthe highlights and shadows are smooth. Now taking  \na look at Bella Thorne's retouched pictures, none \nof them show her real face. Since she has a lot  \nof stretched pores on her cheekbones and her \nnose and a lot of moles all over her face.\n \nThis is what's considered a defining feature or \na characteristic feature along with her various  \nmoles which you cannot spot them in any of these \nretouched pictures. If it was up to us to edit  \nthis picture. This is how we would go about \nit. We're going to go a little quicker here  \nas we don't want the video to end tomorrow. We're \ngoing to go a little overboard here to show you  \nthe extreme case of retouching. So we're \ngoing to get rid of the stretched pores, fix  \nsome of the harsh highlights and shadows, get \nrid of the little blemishes and that's about it.  \nYou do not touch the moles or the skin colour \nor anything else that's unique to that person.\n \nThat's how you should retouch.\nFix the little imperfections,  \nbut do not get rid of the characteristic features \nof the face or whatever you're retouching and the  \ncharacteristic feature in this case are her \nmoles. We're just going to keep the moles and  \nsmooth the highlights and shadows out.\nObviously it's not gonna look perfect  \nsince we finished the retouching in under 7 \nminutes. Usually, retouching a picture takes  \nfrom an hour to five hours to eight hours, \ndepending on how detailed you want it to be  \nand what kind of a picture it is. This is \nwhat it should look like after retouching  \nor this is what it should look close to. \nBut this is what they look like.\n \nLet's finish this episode on somewhat of a high \nnote. Here we have Kim Kardashian on the cover  \nof Vogue magazine where, surprisingly they did \nnot edit any of the texture out. It might have  \nbeen slightly retouched but nothing too much \nthat stands out which is a sign of a good edit.  \nCompare it to this one and it looks flat as \nalways which is a trademark of the Kardashian  \nfamily edits where they are just allergic to any \nhuman characteristics of the face or the body.  \nWe can use the same technique here to create \nthe skin texture but as we already mentioned,  \nit only works for a certain type of images. To \nfix this one, we have to copy the texture from  \na different picture and paste it on her face and \nbody but this was more of a comparison between the  \npictures she posted and the one that the magazine \nposted. So we're just going to stop here. And  \nif you find similar textureless edits \nor the unrealistic proportions anywhere,  \nleave the links in the comments below. We will \nanalyze them in our next episode.\n \nAlright, that brings another episode to a close. \nHopefully you learnt something about Photoshop  \ntechniques.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Video Title: To Shave Or Not To Shave? | What Is The Ideal Amount of Facial Hair?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "﻿What is the perfect facial hair \nfor facial attractiveness?\n \nMale facial hair has seen many trends \nand fashion fads over the years  \nwith at least one website per year claiming that \nfacial hair is no longer in fashion. However,  \nthat couldn’t be further from the truth. Facial \nhair is always in fashion and it is more than just  \na fashion statement. In fact, it is saturated with \nsocial cues and determines how a man is perceived  \nby other males and females in the social setting. \nMoreover, facial hair or beards play a significant  \nrole in a man’s social and personal life. \nBeards and mustaches, or male facial hair,  \nplay a vital role in how a man is perceived and \nwhat opportunities are made available to him,  \nsocially, personally, and professionally. \nDifferent types of male facial hair allow  \nmen to be perceived as masculine, aggressive, \nsocially and physically mature, and dominant  \nwhich consequently affects every single \nopportunity that is ever presented to them. \n \nResearchers at Northumbria University performed \na study with the purpose of assessing the female  \nperception of male facial hair. This research \nis considered to be conclusive research on the  \ntopic of facial hair and its perception as it \nhas very few limitations and it was performed  \nsuch that it proves the points raised by other \nresearchers on the same topic that they could  \nnever prove themselves. The study focused on how \nwomen perceived different types of beards and  \nwhat character traits they associated with the \nspecific type of facial hair. For the purpose of  \nthis study, researchers created pictures of 10 \nclean-shaven men using the FACES software. The  \nFACES software uses a wide database to research \nand create faces with general and popular  \nfeatures. These pictures were then rated out of \n10 by 16 of the female participants, with 1 being  \nunattractive and 10 being extremely attractive. \nThis first round of analysis only focused  \nentirely on the female perception of male facial \nfeatures and their apparent attractiveness. \n \nAfter the female participants rated these \n10 pictures, 3 pictures were found to have  \nsimilar attractiveness ratings and were \nchosen to progress to the next phase.  \nIn this phase, the remaining 60 female \nparticipants were shown the 3 pictures but each  \npicture was processed to create five different \npictures; Picture of the same face was altered  \nto have a clean-shaven appearance, light stubble, \nheavy stubble, light beard, and full beard.  \nThis resulted in a total of 15 pictures that were \nshown to women participating in the study. \n \nAccording to the results of the study, most women \nfound men with light beards and full beards to be  \nmasculine, aggressive, and older than those with \nlight stubble or clean-shaven appearance. It is  \nimportant to note that although masculinity is \na trait often sought after in social situations,  \ntoo much of it can be off-putting. And that was \nfound to be the case with the participants of this  \nstudy. However, they associated these men to be \nmore socially mature than those with a clean shave  \nand light stubble, which is a positive trait \nto have in social relationships. This group of  \nmales had both positives and negatives but the \nnegative traits outshone the positive, resulting  \nin women rating them as least attractive. In \nfact, most females perceived the younger-looking  \nmale pictures, those with light stubble or \nheavy stubble to be more attractive. \n \nAs you should be getting used to by now, \nmake sure to like this video to help the  \nQOVES channel, and subscribe for much more \nrelevant content about facial aesthetics research.  \nYou do that and we’ll show you this.  \nAnyway, It is important to mention that these  \nratings of attractiveness and the \nperception of women were affected  \nby the social norms surrounding male facial \nhair. Up until the level of heavy stubble,  \nmale facial hair may be perceived as a sign of \nsocial maturity, intelligence, and respectability.  \nHowever, higher levels of facial hair may \npoint towards non-conformity, shabbiness,  \nand a general disregard for social norms. A full \nbeard that is not maintained or trimmed further  \nexaggerates these perspectives and can result \nin women finding even the most attractive facial  \nfeatures unattractive. All of this combined \nwith the drastic difference in social norms  \nand their effects on facial attractiveness based \non levels of facial hair may affect women’s  \nperception and their attractiveness ratings. \nThis is especially apparent when considering  \nfacial hair in different cultures and how women \nof different cultures respond to the levels of  \nfacial hair. For example, Caucasian young \nadults with clean shave or light stubble  \nmay be considered to be attractive \nwhereas Middle Eastern young adult males  \nwould require at least heavy stubble or light \nbeard to be considered attractive. \n \nIf we consider this graph in more detail, \ntaken from an Australian study in 2013,  \nwe can see that facial hair on a man can \nsubconsciously impact a variety of socially  \nrelevant judgements. There are obvious socially \nrelevant criteria that facial hair can impact,  \nsuch as the masculinity of a man. As facial hair \nis seen as a sexually dimorphic feature, it makes  \nsense that greater amounts of facial hair increase \nthe mean rating of an individual’s masculinity.  \nJust to recall, sexual dimorphic features refer to \nany feature that are different for men and women,  \nyou can learn more about that with \nspecific reference to facial hair here.  \nIn this case, the fact that most men can grow \nfacial hair and most women cannot means that  \nfacial hair is a sexualy dimorphic feature.\nLooking back to the graphs, we can see that facial  \nhair has a more convoluted relationship \nto the perceived health of an individual.  \nWith females represented through the white \nbars, and males through the dark bar, it is  \nseen that a full beard is also the best indicator \nof health. This may be due to the fact that facial  \nhair signifies continual growth, and for the \nmost part, continual growth represents health.  \nPerhaps the most surprising correlation is \nthat a full beard correlates to the greatest  \nperceived parenting ability. This may have \nits roots in a beard signifying maturity,  \nand also may be inter-correlated to the fact \nthat facial hair signals masculinity.  \n \nIn general, women preferred males who could grow \na beard as their partners as it indicated physical  \nmaturity but did not prefer men who had full \nbeards as that just pointed towards older age.  \nThis pattern was also seen when female \nparticipants were asked to choose amongst  \nthe 15 pictures for who they would prefer for \nboth, long-term and short-term relationships.  \nWhile the women preferred those with \nlight stubble and heavy stubble,  \nthey steered clear of anyone with \na full beard or a clean shave.  \nThis provides further proof that although women \nprefer a physically mature male, they are not big  \nfans of men who appear older. \nAn important thing to note here  \nis that although the participants in this study \nassociated the pictures of men with full beards  \nwith old age and pictures of men with light \nstubble and heavy stubble with the prime age,  \nthe actual age gap between these pictures is not \nas severe but rather just a moderate age gap of  \napproximately 4 to 5 years. But female perception \ntells a different story completely. \n \nThe verdict here is that facial hair is important \nfor the positive perception of men by women,  \nboth socially and sexually. However, the type \nof facial hair makes all the differencebetween  \nlong and short term relationship success. A light \nto heavy stubble, indicating men’s ability to grow  \na beard, is the perfect facial hair for men to \nbe perceived as attractive, masculine enough,  \nand socially mature individuals who would \nmake great long-term and short-term partners."}]}

Now you can see in these example images  \nthat even though they do have a lot of makeup on \nyou can still see the imperfections on the skin.  \nThere's a lot of contrast between the highlights \nand the shadows and it didn't just disappear even  \nthough they're wearing makeup too. You can notice \nit in all three of the examples that all the skin  \ndetails are maintained, and that's how makeup \nactually works. It enhances your features and  \nhides some of the little imperfections \nbut not as much as it does on her face. \n \nWe've covered examples like these on our channel \nlots of times and to fix this we have always gone  \nwith the Sandstone texture, but here we're \ngoing to use a simple skin texture brush,  \npaint the texture and erase it from the parts \nwe don't need, use the blend if slider to make  \nit show up only in the shadows and finally, to \nadd more variation in the shadows on her skin  \nwe're going to use a curves adjustment layer, \ninverse the Mask paint in the shadows and  \nincrease the feather of the mask to give it a more \nsofter look. It still doesn't look perfect even  \nthough there is some skin texture visible but \nthe skin doesn't really work that way because  \nthere are no repeating patterns and the texture \nisn't the same in two different spots. So this  \nis as far as we can go. There was another photo \nthat on the Instagram versus Reality subreddit  \nwhere they took this potato and put makeup on \nand it looked like this. That's what most of  \nthese bad edits look like in terms of skin tone, \nwhen they should look like this and this. \n \nMoving on to the next picture, it's, well it \nis beyond ridiculous. It's another picture  \nsimilar to the one in our last episode where \nthe guy changed races and had a sharp beard.  \nNow he isn't that dark skinned as you can see from \nhis ear, the darkest shade is still a dark pink,  \nbut the way they've edited this picture, giving \nhim a beard like that, it reminds me of this guy.  \nIt's exactly the same, with the beard so sharp. \nAgain, as is the case, usually with edits like  \nthese, there are no highlights and shadows. To \nanalyze that we're going to use a black and white  \nadjustment layer to give us a better idea of how \nthe lights and the shadows have been flattened  \non his face. Since we've taken the color away, \nand it's only the light values that you see and  \nas you move the Color Picker throughout his skin, \nyou can see it's just that single shade of gray,  \nwhich means that the light throughout his face \nis of the same value. Now, if we look at the  \ncolors there’s a single shade of pink. We can \nconfirm it by again using the color picker and  \npainting the colours on a new layer. As you can \nsee, there are no highlights and shadows. It's  \nthe same shade of pink with no highlight (shades \nof pink closer to white) and shadow (shades of  \npink closer to black) colours and if we take a \npaintbrush and start painting around his face,  \nit doesn’t look odd or out of place because that \nis what it is, it's just color but with different  \nshades and since there is no texture. It’s \nbasically a cartoon at this point, but they left  \nthe other details in because it’s much harder to \npaint those so at this point this guy looks like  \na mix between Johnny Bravo and the Pixel Gun 3D \ncharacter. This picture is a “gentle” reminder of  \nhow not to edit your pictures. There’s no fixing \nit, I mean we can, but at that point we’re just  \npainting a new face rather than just retouching. \nIf we were to fix such a picture, we’re gonna need  \na new “art restoration” channel for that, where \nwe restore these badly edited “art pieces”.\n \nThe next picture we have is of another textureless \nguy. You can see on his chin that they, for some  \nreason, colored over his beard to get rid \nof it. Again, you don't need to be an expert  \nto find out that this picture has been edited. \nSince it’s another one of those pictures where  \nthe texture is completely gone, we're going \nto use the same old technique of adding a 50%  \ngray layer, changing the blend mode to overlay \nadding the sandstone texture on top of it,  \nselecting the direction of the light which in \nthis case is right or top right, but it doesn't  \nmatter because the picture is of low quality \nas always. finally we take it away from the  \nhighlights and for the shadows, we’re gonna do \nthe same thing we did in the previous example.  \nTake a curves adjustment layer, bring the \nmidpoint down and paint in the shadows  \nand increase the feather till it looks soft \nenough to look believable. Now, it's not perfect,  \nas is the case with low res pictures like this, \nbut it is so much better than the original.\n \nHere we have one of those weird product photoshops \nwhere companies like Shein, as we’ve shown in one  \nof our previous episodes, either photoshop the \nmodels or the clothes on top of the models and  \nthat too very poorly. This one was on Amazon, and \nit’s a special kind of waist trainer which makes  \nyour waist smaller, your elbows swollen and your \nhips wide way beyond your natural proportions. You  \ncan spot this bad edit from far away too because \nit’s so obvious and you can see her elbows are  \nfollowing the contours of her body and her hips \ndo not match the rest of her proportions.\n \nBefore I show you what she actually looks like, \nif you’re enjoying the video leave a like and  \nsubscribe to the channel for more Instagram \nReality and Beauty Standard talk. Also, all of the  \nphotos and plenty of other morphs are available \non our Instagram so chuck us a follow there\n \n.\nFor this one we're going to use the same old  \nliquify tool again, slowly pushing the pixels back \nto where they are supposed to be. Since we do not  \nknow the actual proportions of the model, we're \ngoing to have to guess and even if we do not get  \nthe perfect proportions we can see that it is so \nmuch better than the bent and swollen elbows.\n \nThe next one is similar, although it's not a \nproduct advertisement but the woman is wearing  \na corset and it has cinched her waist and also \nwidened her hips beyond the natural proportions.  \nYou can see her left arm is very curvy and \nit’s following the contours of her body  \nand that’s enough proof to convince you that \nalmost all the pictures you see of corsets,  \nthey’ve been edited to look that way.\nTo fix it, we're going to use the liquify tool,  \nagain, slowly bringing the waist back to \nwhere it looks natural and you can see the  \ndifference that it is much more believable than \nthe original.Still a very thin waist but not  \ngravity defying proportions anymore.\nHere is another one of those impossible  \nproportions that we cover on this channel all the \ntime. This one is kind of hard to spot because  \nshe's not in front of a busy background, \nit’s a plain door. Which, I’m pretty sure,  \nwas intentional because it makes editing so much \neasier without any discernible modifications  \nto the background. This little bump could \neither be protruding like that because she  \nis really that skinny and it’s her actual pelvic \nbone (the anterior superior iliac spine) or that  \nis the point where she bent her waist from. As we \nhave mentioned before, when you see a questionable  \nimage like this, you start to suspect everything \nin the picture. To confirm this suspicion,  \nyou can check by using the line tool to see if \nher waist is smaller than her head and here it is,  \nso the picture has definitely been edited.\nSo to properly edit this one, again,  \nwe’re going to use the liquify tool to bring her \nwaist back to, although not the original size,  \nbut to a realistic one.You can see \nthat this one is so much better than  \nthe original’s unrealistic proportions.\nMoving on to a similar example, which in terms  \nof editing is actually good but in terms of body \nproportions is impossible. Here, again you can see  \nthat her waist is smaller than her head. So it’s \nobviously been edited too. When we fix this one,  \nwe're surely going to distort the background. \nThere's a lot of ways to remedy that.  \nWe could select the model and use the \nliquify tool on her or use the freeze  \nmask option in the liquify dialog box to freeze \nthe pixels in the background and move her around  \nfreely. But we're going to go with a simple \none. We're going to bring the pixels back in  \nusing the liquify tool and we're gonna use the \nduplicate of the original background layer and use  \nthe clone stamp tool to fill the rest back in.\nAs you see the before and the after, this one is  \nmore believable and more realistic.\nOur last example is another one of those  \npictures where the editor does \nnot understand how poses work.  \nWe've covered examples like this in our previous \nvideos where the lady looked like she was pregnant  \neven though it was her hip bulged out by the \neditor. I genuinely do not understand how an  \neditor and the person that the editor is editing \nthe picture for, thinks this is a job well done.  \nYou can even see that her hand looks \nlike it’s hovering over her waist  \nand the shadows have been painted in. \nThis one is going to take some time to fix  \nbut to show you the difference of how it should \nlook like and how it actually does, we're gonna  \nduplicate that part of the image and use the \nclone stamp tool to extend it. duplicate her  \nright hip onto a different layer so we can put it \non top and move it to a more appropriate position,  \nmask out the parts that we don't need. Now, you \ncan see that this picture looks normal. \n \nAlright, that brings another episode to a close. \nHopefully you’ve learnt something about Photoshop  \ntechniques. We’ve covered everything here in a \nprevious video somewhere along in the series so  \nI recommend watching it all to get upto \ndate. I encourage you to follow us on  \nInstagram where we post quality morphs and \nbefore and afters of the examples used here  \nso you can see for yourself.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Video Title: How Climate Influences Your Nose Shape | Defining Beauty"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "With over 15 million procedures being performed\nin 2019 just in the United States alone, and\nrhinoplastic surgery making up the majority\nof this, people are having more surgeries\nnow than ever before.\nAs it turns out, climate has a huge influence\nin how your nose is shaped, for example, the\nsharp, upturned peaks of Scandanavian noses\ncompared to the flat and wide shapes of sub\nSaharan African ones.\nThe noses of individuals are heavily shaped\nby genetic influences of their ancestors',\nwhich in turn have gone through a process\nof natural selection, across generations , to\nbest adapt to their climate.\nIn the tropics, where the air is warm, evolutionary\nchanges have occurred over time affecting\nthe noses of their inhabitants, with noses\nthat are more flat with nostrils open and\nwide acting as a favorable genetic marker.\nQuite simply put, The greater width of the\nnose increases the potential intake of air\nneeded in warmer climates, and has hence served\nas an evolutionary advantage for populations\nliving in the tropics.\nIf we were to place individuals with this\nopen and wide nose evolutionary trait in colder\nclimates, the increased potential intake of\nair would serve as an evolutionary disadvantage,\nallowing masses of cold air to enter and irritate\nthe membranous lining.\nA landmark research article by Zaidi et. al.\nspeaks to the case that adaptations to climate\nhave caused observed differences in nose shapes\namong populations around the world.\nThe study included 2637 participants with\nrelevant genetic ancestry data, which is an\nimpressively culturally diverse sample size\nfor data collected exclusively in the United\nStates.\nTo give context to the paper, genetic scientists\nhave been studying and measuring Noses and\nextracting meaning from their results for\nan age now, with Thomson and Buxton publishing\nan historic paper in 1923.\nThe paper demonstrated significant differences\nbetween 242 different crania (or skulls),\nby using a mathematical ‘nasal index’,\nfinding ethnic differences for crania composition.\nFor example, the skull (on the left) is an\nAlgonquin Indian exhibiting a narrow nose\nwith a nasal index of 39.4.\nOn the other hand, on the right is a North-west\nAustralian with a wide nose, has an index\nof 55.4.\nClose to a century later, in 2017, Zaidi et.\nal. have improved the sophistication of Thomson\nand Buxton’s measuring techniques to prove\nvariation in nose shape between West-African,\nEast-Asian, Northern European and Southern\nAsian populations by statistically modelling\n3D images of participants’ faces using the\n3dMD Face system.\nWith the ability to model noses using imaging\nsystems, 5 nasal distances and 2 areas from\nevery nose were measured to quantitatively\ncompare the shapes and sizes of noses between\npopulations.\nThe distances included the ‘Nares width’,\na measurement of the distance between the\ntwo alares of the nose as shown in the picture.\nThe ‘Alar base width’, similar to the\nNares width, but measuring from the base of\nthe nose.\nThe ‘Nasal height’, measured from the\ntop of the nose (known as the ‘Nasion’,\nlabelled ‘n’) to the bottom of the nose\n(the ‘Subnasale’, labelled ‘sn’).\nThe ‘Nasal Ridge length’, measured from\nthe top of the nose (The nasion) to the point\nof the nose (known as the ‘pronasale’,\nlabelled ‘prn’).\nAnd the final distance, the ‘Nasal tip protrusion’,\nmeasured from the point of the nose, the pronasale,\nto the bottom of the nose, the subnasale.\nContinuing, the areas from every nose that\nwere measured were the Overall area and the\nnostril area, both pictured.\nWhat follows now is the data collated for\nthe nose shape and size of each ethnic population.\nFeel free to pause the video here to make\nyour own inferences from the graphs provided\nhere, but a summarised table will detail the\nimportant findings from the dataset.\nFrom the report, it can be seen that West\nAfricans have the largest Nares width, Alares\nbase width, and the smallest nasal tip protrusion.\nThis correlates to a wide and flat nose.\nIt was also recorded that Northern Europeans\nhave the smallest nares width and alares base\nwidth, with the greatest nasal tip protrusion.\nThis actualises to a tall, point and thin\nnose.\nEast Asians were also found to have the smallest\nnoses in terms of external surface area, and\nthe smallest nasal tip protrusion.\nThis results in a small and short nose.\nTo confirm what the data collected shows,\nWest African males and Females have the largest\nNares width and alares base width and Northern\nEuropean men and women have the smallest.\nEast Asian men and West African females have\nthe greatest nasal height, whilst all South\nAsians have the smallest.\nNow, with all the data modelling complete\nand analysed, the researchers of this paper\nset out to evidence that these differences\nin nose shape and size between African, Asian\nand European populations was due to the evolutionary\nbenefits unique to each of those climates.\nThat is, that the results of the differing\nnose shapes were due to differing climates,\nabove and beyond the effect of Genetic drift.\nGenetic drift is the phenomenon in which frequencies\nof a certain characteristic change over generations\ndue to chance.\nIn the ladybug example, the chance event of\na group of bugs being swatted has resulted\nin a population decrease in blue bugs.\nWhen it comes time for these bugs to reproduce,\nonly a small amount will continue to hold\nthe blue trait.\nOvertime, by chance, the overall characteristics\nof the population will change.\nIt should be noted that Genetic drift is unlikely\nin a large sample size.\nTo recognise which measurements of the nose\nsize and shape had differences that could\nnot be attributed to genetic drift alone,\nthe authors of the paper comprised a formula\nand statistical procedure that assessed the\nvariation of the data sets.\nThe statistical explanation behind the formula\nis complex, however, statistically significant\nresults from the data found through probability\nvalues of less than 0.05 (that is, less than\na 5% chance that we are wrong in assuming\nthe data is meaningful) meant that there was\na difference beyond genetic drift.\nIn the graph pictured, Qst-Fst refers to the\nformula priorly mentioned, with larger resultant\nvalues from the formula directly corresponding\nto smaller p-values (and hence more evidence\nthat there is an effect beyond genetic drift).\nThe red and orange violin shaped data plots,\nrepresenting ‘Skin pigmentation’, ‘Nares\nwidth’, ‘Alar base width’ and ‘Nasal\ntip protrusion’ are the measurements that\nare found to have significant effects beyond\ngenetic drift, evidenced by p-values less\nthan 0.05, as shown from the coding scheme\non the side.\nThat is, the differences in these four factors\nbetween West African, Northern European and\nSouth and East Asian populations are caused\nby differences in climates.\nWhen we think of this logically, it makes\ncomplete sense that Skin Pigmentation, which\nhas not been mentioned priorly, differs for\nclimates, as can be seen here.\nIt is interesting when we consider the parallel\nbetween these findings and those of skin pigmentation\nin populations, stressing the influence of\nthe climate on human physical adaptations.\nWe covered skin tone adaptations in our video\nhere, so pay that a visit but before you do,\nleave a like on this video in return for a\n3 second blooper reel of me messing up the\nrecording.\n[insert z1 audio]\nHow does this relate to you?\nHow the objective differences in nose shape\nand size between populations link to the aesthetics\nand perceived attractiveness of individuals\nis a different can of worms.\nWe’re of the belief that there is no perfect\nnose shape but there are aggravating and mitigating\nfactors to attractiveness.\nUnlike a jaw which can have different levels\nof protrusion and misalignment that decrease\nor increase their attractiveness quite linearly\nand objectively, for instance a Scandanavian\ncan have more or less the same jaw shape as\nan Indigineous Aboriginal, with the noses\nbeing linked to climate there is an incredibly\ndiverse range of shapes and types to consider,\nmaking their attraction much more subjective\nthan other features.\nHowever it is important to recognise deformities\nfrom simply different nose shapes.\nSaddle noses caused by blunt force trauma,\na deviated septum which can affect breathing,\nswollen lymph nodes and a prominent dorsal\nhump caused by excess cartilage, weak facial\ndevelopment or again trauma.\nNasal hump correction, aka the dorsal hump\nbecause it usually occurs at the dorsum of\nthe nose, is the most common reason for cosmetic\nrhinoplasty because it is an incredibly masculinizing\nfeature.\nNative Americans harmonize best with this\nmasculine nose shape because they have very\nwide and strong faces due to their tough diet\nand child rearing traditions.\nFor instance they use cradleboards to keep\ninfants on their backs so that their soft\nskulls form aesthetically strong and wide\nand not narrow and dolichocephalic with a\nlarge occipital bone like some type of alien.\nFor people of other ethnicities with more\nfeminine features, it doesn’t work as well\nand so correcton is often desired.\nTo summarise, the findings of Zaidi et.\nAl's paper demonstrates that nose width, projection,\nand nostril size vary by geographic location,\nhighlighting an evolutionary adaptation of\npeople over time to their climate.\nIf living in colder climates, over time, populations\nwill have a greater proportion of people with\nsmaller and thinner noses to avoid sucking\nin too much stinging cold air, protecting\nthe inner lining of their nose.\nOn the contrary, living in warmer climates\nresults in larger and wider noses, allowing\nfor more intake of air for physical activity"}]}

This week’s  \nsubmissions are from r/instagramreality. \nFor our first pi cture we have an example of bad  \nediting by improperly balancing light reflections. \nThere are a lot of things wrong with this picture;  \nher skin is way too perfect without any of the \nsurface imperfections, her nose has no definition  \nwhatsoever as all the shadows have been brightened \nout of the picture, and on top of all of that,  \nshe has digital makeup plastered on her face which \nmakes it look even less real. Even though there  \nare plenty of mistakes in the editing, the most \nobvious one is the light reflecting on he r skin.  \nIt is so harsh that it makes her look like she has \nhorns sticking out of her face. We could've let  \nthis go if it was someone who edited the picture \non their phone or didn't know exactly how to do it  \nbut this picture has been taken by someone who at \nleast knows what they’re doing as you can see from  \nthe ring light reflection in her eyes and from her \nattire, it might have been a wedding photoshoot.  \nThe ring light should have been diffused, \nor better yet a studio production would  \nrather use a softbox lighting setup as that \nprovides a more consistent flood of light rather  \nthan the concentrated beam you get from a ring \nlight, which is a much more amateur setup.\n \nTo fix this one we're going to use frequency \nseparation, which we have talked about in our  \nprevious videos. Frequency separation is the \nprocess of setting the two parts of an image  \naside, the color and the texture, to edit each \nindividually. We're gonna be working on the color  \nlayer. First, run the frequency separation action \nto create a new layer between the high frequency  \nand the low frequency layer. For those of \nyou unfamiliar with Actions in Photoshop,  \nthese are just saved instructions that do the \nnitty gritty work for us in one click and you  \ncan download your own online. This allows us to \nthen paint with a color sampled from her skin  \nto smoothen out the harsh highlights. We're \ngoing to also use a selection with about 10  \npixels of feathering and blur the colour layer \nwith the selections made from the lasso tool.  \nYou can see that with just that simple \nadjustment, the picture looks less harsh. \n \nMoving on, we have a fitness model, but as you can \nclearly see by the bendy lines in the background  \nthat these are not real gains, but actually Adobe \ngains. It’s likely that she is probably doing  \nthe edit on her phone, because while \nthe amount of distortion is subtle,  \na large area is affected each time, almost \nthe size of a finger on a phone screen.  \nIt’s disappointing that as a fitness model \npreaching healthy gains she felt the need to  \nrisk it all for such a minor improvement and we \nsee this time and time again every week.\n \nTo correct this, we're using the trusty liquify \ntool to bring the lines back to where they belong.  \nAgain, there’s only a minor difference between the \nbefore and the after, like a lot of the pictures  \nwe've shown in our previous videos. I'm going to \nlet you in on a big secret here. For this example,  \nusing our corrected version, I can \nmodify her body however it needs to  \nbe and then use the reconstruct tool on \nthe side to correct the bending lines.  \nThis essentially undoes the distortion youve \napplied, so you get the benefits of using a big  \nbrush and maintaining a smooth , consistent \ncontour, and the benefits of a small brush  \nselectively undoing the regions you do not \nwant to disturb. If you properly understand  \nhow to use the tools at your disposal, this \nis a big game changer as now, her butt is 20%  \nbigger but the lines are straight. Thankfully, \nmost fitness influencers do not watch our videos  \nso they’ll keep making the same mistakes \nand we’ll have content for next week.\n \nWe have another bad marketing Photoshop and again \nlike our previous example, it is another case of  \nnot understanding how light works. Since the \nhighlights and the shadows have been flattened  \non her upper eyelid, it makes it look like she \ndoesn't even have an eyeball. No matter what  \nbrand of eyeshadow you use, it's not gonna change \nhow the light bounces off your eyelids. As you can  \nsee in these examples, they have prominent \nhighlights in the middle and shadows on the  \nsides and that's what makes our eyes look round \nwhen we close our eyes. To fix this, we can use  \na lighter shade of her skin color to paint in the \nhighlights, and shadows to blur both the layers.  \nAfter lowering the opacity, you can see that \nit looks like she actually has an eyeball.\n \nThe next picture is disappointing on \nso many levels. We talk about beauty  \nstandards on our channel and how different \ncultures, geographically have different  \nbeauty standards.This example is from India where \nhaving fair skin is a prevalent beauty standard  \nand it's apparent everywhere from Models to \nBollywood actors who endorse skin bleaching  \ncosmetics that give you fair skin. There’s even \nlight bulbs that can make your skin color lighter.  \nYes, sounds bizarre but here it is, in all its \nglory. This is one of those pictures where you  \ncan spot the mistake from light years away. \nHe has cropped the picture to avoid painting  \nthe details on his hands, which is a very tedious \ntask, and so its easier to only work on the face  \nsince there's already some information there. He \nbumped up the brightness and the contrast, painted  \nout the eyes and eyebrows, and used a gray color \nto paint in the beard. If you zoom in, you can see  \nthat those are not actual hair strands, but rather \na blob of greyish black color painted on his face.  \nNow let's talk about how it should have been \nedited. Considering it's a very dimly lit picture  \nand probably taken on a phone, there's not \nenough information present to do much here  \nanyway. The only thing we can do is bring up \nthe curves in the mid tones with the midpoint  \nto bump up the exposure. This obviously is going \nto be too much but we can mask in the parts we  \nneed and drop the opacity a tad. That is what \nretouching is all about. It's about removing  \nthe little imperfections, and fixing minor issues \nlike flyaway hairs, blemishes and color grading,  \nnot changing the entire look and \npersonality of the subject. \n \nThis is another liquify fail and you can tell \nby the distorted cupboard in the background  \nand the bent handles of the cupboard \nwhich follows the contours of her body.  \nWe cover examples like this on our channel all \nthe time and the remedy is always the same,  \nthe liquify tool. We can straighten out the lines, \npush the pixels back to their original position  \nand you can see that it's not too different \nfrom the original so it's just one of those  \nunnecessary edits. The only good thing about \nthis picture is that they have left the rest  \nof the picture untouched which is how you're \nsupposed to edit a picture in the first place.  \nThey have kept her knees intact because \nthere's another trend going on where  \npeople get rid of their knee creases. They smooth \nout the colors, which makes the legs look like  \ngiant hot dogs. \nMoving on, this is actually one  \nof the best edits that I've seen so far. \nShe's done two things with this picture\n \n* Changed the background\n* Reduced her waist size\n \nIf it wasn't for the unnaturally sized waist, you \ncouldn't even tell that this picture was edited.\n \nWe're gonna use a black and white check \nlayer to spot the editing mistakes.  \nAs you can see, her trousers and her hair \nare way darker than they’re supposed to be.  \nThe hair above her hand is too light and there's \nno light source on that side of the picture  \nsince the sun is on the left side. Now, the \ncontrast can easily be fixed by using either a  \nbrightness/contrast layer or a levels adjustment. \nWith these, we can bring the black point down and  \nuse a layer mask to paint in the parts \nthat are required, which in this case  \nare her trousers and her hair. With only \nthat small adjustment, you can already see  \nit looks more cohesive as if she actually was \npresent there even though this picture looks  \nsuspicious as her body perspective gives the \nbackground away as being edited in. For the  \nwaist we're going to use the liquify tool again \nto bring her body back to a natural size.\n \nThe next picture is of our favorite family, the \nKardashians. This time it's a nice family photo,  \nor maybe not a family photo because some of them \nare not present in the picture and those who are,  \naren’t actually there either (Looking at you \nKourtney). This is similar to our previous example  \nas you can see the contrast differences. She has \nway less contrast than the rest of this picture,  \nlike the blacks (shadows) on her hair, and her \nshoes. We can check that by using a black and  \nwhite adjustment layer and you can clearly see the \nblacks on her hair do not match with the rest of  \nthis picture and even her jacket. To make her look \nlike she's actually there, we're using the same  \ntechnique used in our previous example but instead \nof decreasing the contrast, we're increasing it.  \nFinally, we drop the opacity down to \nmatch it with the rest of the picture.\n \nThere's one thing that I missed before and it \nwas her shoes. They have no contact shadows which  \nsolidified the fact that she was not present in \nthis picture, but was photoshopped in later on.  \nI genuinely don’t believe that this photo is \nentirely real and the Kardashian’s actually  \nmade this big of a blunder, but it popped \nup on the r/instagramreality subreddit  \nand I think it’s a good teaching moment. Another \nthing that we noticed is this weird halo or a rim  \nlight around her head which happens when \nyou do not mask the subject properly. It  \nshouldn't have been a problem because here \nshe doesn't have frizzy hair and it is the  \neasiest selection you could ever make, but they \nmissed the rest of the mistakes so it’s probably  \nan avant garde artpiece at this point. \nOkay, so this is after the voiceover was recorded,  \nand turns out Kim actually did post this, \nfinally proving once and for all the Kardashian  \nclan truly think their audience is downright \nstupid. E Online quotes a mysterious source  \nclose to the family citing that Kourtney was \nthere, but considering the lack of shadows,  \nmismatched contrast and the sole fact that they’ve \nbeen caught editing their photos for the last  \n10 episodes we’ve made, I’m going to say \nshe was edited in. That also explains why  \nscott doesn’t have his arms around her, \nbecause none of these 3 are actually here.  \nWhen you zoom into Kendall’s arm, the shadow cast \nis very dark and unnatural, truly bizarre.\n \nTo fix the shadows we're going to grab a \nbrush and pick a dark color from the picture,  \npaint the shadows under her shoes, change the \nblending mode to darken and blur it. As you can  \nsee when you zoom out, it's not that noticeable, \nbut it does make a subtle difference and in turn  \nmake it a little more believable. \nThe final picture is one of those weird  \nKardashian edits that we've covered in a previous \nvideo too. Here, they’ve photoshopped the strap  \nof Kendall Jenner's dress. You can see it \ngoes up from here, fades into her skin,  \nthen comes back again but near her neck. \nI've known better not to question why the  \nKardashians do this, but let's move on to \nfixing it. We need to select the dresss trap,  \nwhich you can do in a number of ways, but \nwe're going to use color range to select it.  \nDuplicate it onto a new layer and move it to \nthe position where we need and we may need to  \ndistort it to fit the original position. Remove \nthe original strap by using either the clone stamp  \ntool, healing brush or the patch tool but here \nwe’ve used the patch tool. Finally, the strap is  \nwhere it should've been and not where it was \nweirdly pasted. I’d love some explanation or  \nbackstory of what’s going on in the comments.\nAlright, that brings another episode to a close.  \nHopefully you’ve learnt something about Photoshop \ntechniques. We’ve covered everything here in a  \nprevious video somewhere along in the series so \nI recommend watching it all to get upto date. I  \nencourage you to follow us on Instagram where we \npost quality morphs and before and afters of the  \nexamples used here so you can see for yourself. \nAs always, if you’re enjoying the content, you  \ncan support the channel by subscribing and click \nthe notification bell to catch future episodes."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Video Title: What Makes A High Trust Face? | Ryan Gosling Aesthetic Breakdown"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "﻿Few people are quite as established and renowned \nin the Hollywood scene as Ryan Gosling. A name  \nknown to many on the world stage, he supposedly \ndefines the pinnacle of masculine aesthetics.  \nHis charisma and attractiveness have not \nonly catapulted him into Hollywood's elite,  \nbut also cemented his role in romantic movies such \nas the Notebook, and La La Land. Interestingly,  \nwhen compared to other actors like Brad Pitt, Tom \nhanks, or Chris Hemsworth, Ryan gosling's face  \ndeviates from the Hollywood prototype. He doesn't \nhave a masculine jaw or striking eyes, and unlike  \nthe men depicting male beauty standards, Ryan \nGosling has certain indiscreet facial flaws. \n \nHis eyes in particular are one such \nfeature which deviates far from the defined  \n“Ideal”. His palpebral fissure length, the \nactual eye opening itself is only 27.5mm.  \nThis is smaller than the average of 29mm, \nand compared to long vertically narrow eyes,  \nis not considered ideal. His intercanthal width \nor the distance from eye to eye of 30.29mm is  \nalso less than the average of 33mm. Normally, \nthis would mean his Interpupillary distance  \nwould be narrow creating close set eyes, however \nsince his eye length is narrow his interpupillary  \ndistance is also below average.\nInterestingly, not only is a wider  \nInterpupillary distance associated with increased \nperceptions of intelligence, but it is actually  \ncorrelated with IQ. High interpupillary \ndistance resembles the eyes of a dolphin,  \nwhile a very narrow interpupillary distance \nlooks more like a cyclops which could be  \nwhere these perceptions come from. \n. For reference, an extreme example such  \nas Sean O’pry has an eye width of 31mm \n(3 standard deviations above Ryan).  \nThis changes the positioning of his eyes to take \nup more of the face. For proportion, the blackline  \nshould intersect the medial canthus, and the white \nline would intersect the limbus or inner iris,  \nboth of which are mis-positioned on his face. With \nmost conventionally attractive men in Hollywood,  \nthis is not the case and their eyes match their \nfacial width with near perfect proportion\n \nAlthough unconfirmed, many believe that Ryan \nsuffers from , aka Lazy eye, leading to much of  \nthe associated asymmetry we see here. To test if \nthe eyes are truly as asymmetric as they seem, a  \nchimeric morph of his two halves were produced, \nAnd overlaid, correcting for jaw width,  \nshowing that its not as bad as it seems but it is \ndefinitely noticeable and detracts a few points.  \nHis left eye is closer to the \nfacial midline than the right,  \nwhich most people are incredibly perceptive \nto, but cannot accurately pinpoint.\n \nHis eyes also disrupt the harmony of his facial \nfifths, since his eye opening length is small.  \nIdeally all fifths should be equal, but Goslings \nnarrow width, and narrow eye fissure lengths  \ncause large discrepancies. His eyebrows \nare proportionally long for his eyes,  \nas normally the peak of the eyebrow lines up \nwith the eye limbus for men, but in this case  \nit's closer to the lateral canthus (8.4mm away \nfrom the limbus), indicating a larger eye shape  \nwould be more appropriate for his brows. As \nwe’ve covered in our most recent video on brows,  \nthis is a variation of the westmore shape and is \nvery well suited to his face shape giving him a  \nsoft, placid appearance which suits his on screen \nappeal. However, a bit of a longer, thicker brow  \nwould do well to add some additional masculinity \nwhile balancing out his close set eyes.\n \nThe uniqueness of his features is that despite \nthese fundamental ratios not being ideal, he  \nstill manages to look good, but why is that?\nTo truly answer the question, we need to take some  \nmore measurements which are part of what \nmakes a high-trust face. His long midface  \nis compensated for by a tall overall face \nlength. His facial height is 225mm, with  \na large chin making up 36% of the facial thirds \nwith the midface at 31% and upper third at 33%, so  \ntheres clearly some disproportion there too. \nSide profile analysis shows us that his tall chin  \nis actually due to his jaw angle of 133. \nThis is definitely on the more feminine,  \npretty-boy side rather than square and \nmasculine at less than 125. Think of a  \ndrill sergeant vs a Kpop star. With more of \nthe jaw being pointed downwards this increases  \nhis facial length and makes the face narrower.\nWhile lower gonial or jaw angles are preferred on  \nmen for masculinity , Ryan Gosling controversially \nbenefits from this increased vertically downward  \ngrowth. Without this downward growth, his chin \nwould be too short and his lower facial height  \nwould be negatively impacted. In other words, the \npositive effect a lower, masculine gonial angle  \nwould have on the side profile is less than \nthe negative effect it would have on his chin  \nheight which is necessary to balance out his \nlong midface. It should also be noted that the  \nsame study which found a relation between IPD \nand Intelligence, also found the same effect  \nin facial height and intelligence. What \nfor most people would be a flaw, works to  \nhis favour given how tall his face is. \nThis combination of tall midface, tall chin,  \ndeep jaw and close set eyes, exhibits a \ntrustworthy nature. This is partly because facial  \nperceptions of friend or foe are more sensitive to \nthe vertical height of the midface than its width.  \nFindings by Carre et al has shown that vertically \ntaller midfaces such as Ryans are perceived  \nas more trustworthy and vice versa for shorter \nones appearing more aggressive and deceitful.\n \nWhile Ryan has above average width, it also has \nabove average height which is more important.  \nOne study indicated that it takes individuals 170 \nmilliseconds to infer if a stranger is trustworthy  \nor not, based on facial appearance alone and \nthis is based on the dimensions of the midface.  \nThese character attributions show \nbroad cross-cultural consensus  \nand they often result from \novergeneralizing perceptions of a face  \nto quickly gather valid information \nsuch as emotional state or fitness,  \nyou know, things that would tell your ancestors \nnot to mess with this one particular guy.\n \nIn short, having features such as Ryan Goslings, \nof the mentioned high trust midface has been shown  \nto give individuals of different cultures \nall over the world, similar perceptions of  \nsafety and loyalty. Conversely, having the facial \nfeatures of a UFC fighter or boxer would likely  \nhave the opposite effect. Ryan just looks like \nsomeone you could trust to babysit your children,  \nand part of the comes from his \nimperfections making him more human.\n \nResearchers tested this, and investigated \nchildren's responses to faces which had been  \nmorphed to appear more trustworthy (3 standard \ndeviations more than average). The children  \noverwhelmingly chose the trustworthy faces to \nbe nicer. While the evidence isn't concrete,  \nthere are numerous factors which cause a \nface to look higher trust such as the lips,  \nnose, and eyes. Looking at Ryan Gosling's face \nhe has: Higher trust eyes due to their beadier,  \nclose set size, a thinner nasal bridge, \npositively inclined oral commissions,  \nand a broad forehead all of which are juvenile \nfeatures. In comparison, Kit Harington appears  \nto have a lower trust face because of his: \nvertically long eyes, larger nasal bridge,  \nnegatively tilted oral commissions and compact \nmidface. These extremely dimorphic, almost feline  \nfeatures are the opposite of Gosling’s average, \neasy to understand ones. His imperfections, from  \nthe eyes to the crooked nose and tall face make \nhim a more relatable face compared to a perfectly  \nsculpted statue of a person. It is obvious that \neven Hollywood recognizes these traits in their  \ncharacter selection, and therefore Gosling \nwas allowed to star as a dreamy eyed romantic  \nin the notebook, while Kit harington was sent \nto fight white walkers in game of thrones.\n \nRyan Gosling also appears as a high class \nindividual. While this seems presumptuous,  \nthere is surprisingly a significant correlation \nbetween facial features and social class.  \nA recent metaanalysis with various datasets \nconcluded “ various measures of social class  \ntap into the same latent construct of class, and, \nperhaps more important, people’s perceptions of  \nvarious facets of class interrelate strongly. This \nsuggests that perceivers detect the underlying  \nconstruct of social class, regardless of \nhow they are asked to judge social class.  \nThe Author tested different data sets, and \ndefined social class in different ways, but still  \nfound that people were able to estimate social \nclass based solely on facial cues. \n \nOther than good health, there are two equally \ninteresting hypotheses why there are deviations  \nin face which can be linked to social class. \nThe first is that historically, In higher classes  \nthere were clear differences in sexual selection. \nMale opted for femininity, youthfulness, and  \nattractiveness. Females however, often compensated \nfor a lack of attraction with wealth and status  \nsince income and gender inequality were much \nmore prevalent. This created an attractiveness  \nimbalance in high class families where the mother \nwas usually more attractive than the father,  \nleading to the sons having more prominent feminine \nattractive characteristics. The Habsburgs Jaw  \nwas a phenomenon where individuals had both \nmandibular prognathism and maxillary deficiency.  \nIt was found that this was caused due to high \ninbreeding coefficients in the royal family.  \nThis is just one such example where \nrepeated choices in sexual selection  \ndoes have significant alterations in the facial \nstructure of noble or wealthier groups.  \n \nThe second theory explains this phenomenon \nthrough social evolution. Working class males  \nwith professions such as blacksmiths and hunters \nneeded to rely on fighting success and strength  \nto survive while upper class males such as \nmerchants needed intelligence to survive. This  \nleads to facial differences, observed as “fighting \nsuccess” overtime such as a more pronounced  \nbrowridge to protect the eyes. When we analyse the \ndifference between low perceived fighting success  \nand high fighting success, we see a similar \ntrend to high social class and low social class.  \nA 2013 study compared the facial morphology of \nFinnish soldiers in WW2, with their percentage  \nof survival, reproductive success, and \nrank. To ensure similar success of survival,  \nsoldiers were primarily gathered from two \ninfantry regiments. The study concluded that  \nwhile higher FWHR individuals had higher \nfighting success and aggression, thinner  \nfaced individuals had higher ranks. Despite \nthis FWHR didnt have an impact on survival,  \npresumably because higher FWHR individuals, \nwhile appearing more aggressive, had lower ranks  \nand so their better fighting chance survivability \nwould be cancelled out by being sent in as cannon  \nfodder. The study concluded, “Wider-faced males \nexploit trust more often, and others tend to trust  \nthinner-faced males more readily,” which led to \ngetting higher leadership positions Pre-Conflict.  \nNot only does this support the hypothesis, but \nalso that a relatively thinner face, i.e tall and  \nrelatively narrow like Goslings, increases trust \nand looks high class simply by association.\n \nThese facial attributes are also noted in \nHollywood castings such as The Crown’s actor  \nMatt Smith. His long midface and tall skull are \nwhy he was chosen to represent the noble portrayal  \nof Prince Philip. However since Ryan Gosling's \nappeal comes from his high trust, high class and  \noverall social status he looks significantly \nworse without proper grooming to someone more  \nconventionally handsome such as Brad Pitt, \nHenry Cavil or a disheveled Idris Elba..\n \nWhile Ryan may not be conventionally \nattractive, he is a good example of  \nalternative appeal. His features \naren’t very masculine or dimorphic,  \nin fact they’re plain and unassuming but this \ncoincidentally makes him the perfect typecast  \nfor his roles as someone who relies on charm \nand wit. In contrast, someone who is extremely  \nmasculine and dimorphic such as John Hamm or \nHenry Cavil, gets portrayed as the all powerful  \nÜbermensch who imposes his will, most notably in \nthe latest Witcher series. while trustworthy faces  \nlike Ryan’s rely on being comedic relief or the \nsuave savior but never the macho man. Both can be  \nattractive, but its important to realise Ryans \nattraction comes from his on screen portrayal,  \nmuch like how Robert Downey Junior is both \nironman on and off screen, while some of  \nthe truly handsome faces in hollywood were \nknown before they ever made a movie.\n \nIf you would like to get your own face \nassessed, you can order an Aesthetics report  \nover at the qoves website and subscribe \nto the channel to catch future content."}]}

Attractive"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Beautifully formed eyebrows are the hallmark\nof a youthful and glowing face.\nApart from playing an important role in facial\naesthetics, eyebrows are also important for\ndisplaying emotional and non-verbal cues.\nThe role of eyebrows in nonverbal communication\nhas been demonstrated in one such experimental\nstudy that was conducted with the objective\nof understanding facial cues and how eyebrows\ncan be used to express these cues.\nIn this study, the researchers found that\nproficient lip readers assess the whole face,\nespecially the lips and the brows to understand\nevery aspect of the conversation.\nWhile we have always known that eyebrows are\nimportant to non-verbal communication, it’s\nonly recently that we’ve realised just how\nimportant they are to aesthetics in framing\nthe face as well.\nEyebrows are a distinguishing feature of the\nface unique from one person to another as\nproven by research conducted at MIT.\nThe study has shown that eyebrows are as important\nas the eyes for facial recognition.\nAbsence of the eyebrows disrupted facial recognition\nsoftware from recognizing faces and significantly\nimpaired performance.\nTo much surprise, the study also found that\nwhen eyebrows were absent, there was a more\nsignificant impairment in the performance\nof facial recognition software compared to\nwhen the eyes were absent.\nIn other words, these early studies are pointing\nat the brows being more important than the\neyes on the face\nMaintaining the shape of the eyebrows can\nbe a tedious task as they require constant\nattention.\nThe brow itself is controlled by the frontalis\nmuscles which sags downwards with age.\nThis is why high brows are a youthful feature\nas the ptosis (sag) of these muscles is very\ndistinctly noticeable later on and It’s\nalso why brow lifts are a quick fix to rewind\na few years through plastic surgery.\nThe forehead and brow muscles work together\nas one complex, where excessive movement of\nthe brows are linked with forehead wrinkles,\nglabellar wrinkles or frown lines and brow\nsag.\nKeeping up with the trends of changing eyebrow\nfashion is not as easy a task.\nIn our video on historical beauty standards\nhere, we covered how a blurred monobrow was\nthe standard but nowadays its not about the\nsize of the eyebrows but rather how they’re\npositioned.\nA 2016 study from the journal of craniofacial\nsurgery looked at this evolution of eyebrow\nshapes based on pictures published in British\nVogue between 1916 and 2015.\nThe study found that the only thing that didn’t\nchange overtime was the relative width of\nthe eyebrow while every other feature, especially\nthe arch type has changed significantly.\nIn it, they defined 5 brow arches from the\nWestmore to the Hwang named after their respective\nplastic surgeons who preferred that style.\nThe 6th and last style, British Vogue, was\nthe style most commonly seen in its namesake\nmagazine and it’s characterized by exaggeratedly\nlong brow lengths well beyond any proportion\ntests we would commonly use.\nThe most common guidelines we at QOVES use\nfor our facial reports is the westmore standard\ndefined in detail in Yalcinkaya et al’s\npaper as one of the more preferred shapes\nuniversally which itself is based on further\naesthetic research from Gunter 1997 on what\nmakes an attractive eye from which he gave\nhis own set of 8 guidelines.\nWe’ve covered most of this on our video\non eye aesthetics but the most important are\nnumbers 1, 2 and 7 and so we won’t be covering\nthem again here.\nBefore we go back to Eyebrows, let’s talk\nabout the sponsor of today’s video, Skillshare\nfor a second.\nWe get emails all the time from how we edit\nour audio to creating our graphics and it’s\nall mostly done in Adobe After Effects and\nAudacity, nothing fancy.\nThe softwares themselves however, especially\nafter effects can have a steep learning curve\nand so I find skillshare to be incredibly\nvaluable in teaching you not only the basics,\nlike most E-learning platforms, but going\ninto incredibly beneficial niches that will\nactually make you money.\nFor instance, the explainer video series by\nLucas Ridley shows you step by step how to\nrecreate the exact explainer video format\nchannels like Brightside use to rake in millions\nof dollars

shape in photography, which is exactly\nwhat we discussed in our 10th episode on the\nKardashian effect and their choice of camera\nangles.\nI’ve used a range of online learning platforms\nand I have to give credit to Skillshare for\nhaving the most depth in their technical videos\nthat help more advanced users learn new things.\nTheir videos are adfree and seamless, the\nuser experience is

of Skillshare\nPremium Membership so you can learn something\nnew and who knows, start a Youtube channel.\nPreviously, we discussed that the study of\nBritish Vogue identified 6 brow types and\nthat we at QOVES prefer Westmore's shape as\nit’s one of the most universal.\nWestmore’s Brow shape proposes that:\n1.\nThe medial end of the eyebrow (the part closer\nto the center of your face) should be in line\nwith its respective nose wing.\n2.\nThe arch of the eyebrow should be inbetween\nthe iris and lateral canthus (outer eye corner)\n3.\nA line drawn from the lateral end of the eyebrow\nto the nose wing should pass through the lateral\ncanthus\nThere is still a lot of debate over how high\nthe eyebrow should be from the eye and the\nbrow ridge itself but Mckinney 1991 suggests\n5cm for females and 6 for males at an average\nheight of 2.5cm from the pupil.\nHe also suggested a gap of 15mm or 1.5cm from\nthe upper eyelid crease to the base of the\neyebrow that surgeons should maintain for\na brow lift.\nMore contemporary research puts this value\nat 1.6cm and while it may seem little the\npositioning of the brow is incredibly sensitive\nand most female celebrities seem to prefer\na relatively higher position while males prefer\na lower position directly on the brow ridge,\nbecause looking happy and excited all the\ntime doesn't exactly strike fear into your\nenemies.\nNow obviously the Westmore brow shape isn’t\na one size fits all, it’s definitely more\nbiased towards feminine features and Cook\net al criticised the distinct outward arch\nas giving it a surprised look.\nBaker Et al argued that it is dependent on\nthe face shape and is not suited for long\nor square faces.\nIn longer faces, a flatter brow with less\nangular curvature is suitable.\nGoing back to the study on vogue magazine,\nthe researchers found considerable difference\nbetween british vogue and korean print in\npreferred brow type, especially for the Hwang\nshape.\nMen can get away with larger bushier eyes\nthat have less proportion and are rough around\nthe edges.\nIn fact, the more manucirued the brow is,\nespecially the arch angularity, the more metrosexual\nit looks, often having the opposite effect\nof decreasing facial masculinity.\nHowever, with the clients we get for our aesthetic\nreports, the problem is the exact opposite\nwith not enough eyebrow or more commonly,\nthose lacking in colour and darkness at the\nedges.\nThankfully that’s easier to fix with permanent\neyebrow dyes and research has shown topical\nminoxidil to be effective in increasing the\ngrowth of caudal eyebrow hairs\nSo what exactly is the ideal brow shape nowadays?\nOver time, the brow peak has migrated more\nlaterally, towards the side of the face.\nThis migration has resulted in the brow peak\nnow lying either, right over or just medial\nto the edge of the eye.\nAlong with that, lower and flatter eyebrows\nare considered more attractive, compared to\nthe pointed and high-rising eyebrows that\nwere the high point of fashion in the last\ncentury.\nOverall, a lower eyebrow with a slight lateral\npeak is the ideal brow shape in the West.\nIn the East however, research by Jung and\ncolleagues found a greater emphasis on femininity,\nwith softly curved eyebrows with thin black\nhairs as most ideal.\nIn other words, the east prefers to have the\neyebrows blend in with the face rather than\nstanding out as they do as a fashion statement.\nThe West, in particular the anglosphere prefers\nmore masculine characteristics for both men\nand women\nIn order to keep up with the standards, many\nwomen undergo cosmetic procedures such as\nBOTOX injections or endoscopic brow lift procedures\nto achieve the laterally lying brow peak.\nAn open brow lift is also possible but less\ncommon, by cutting along the forehead from\near to ear and lifting the skin higher.\nWhile this may improve the brow position quickly\nit’s at greater risk of having too dramatic\nof an effect that you won’t realise until\nafter its healed.\nOne of the biggest pitfalls to be aware of,\nis over lifting the brow.\nFor aesthetics, it gives the impression of\nan unnatural, unintelligent look and especially\nfor men, raising it even slightly beyond the\nbrow ridge heavily feminizes the face.\nAlso, as research has shown, the arch is the\nmost important aspect of facial expression\nand the way the tail end is shaped influences\nthe look of the entire brow.\nFor men, a tail-up horizontal is preferred\nwhereas for women the arched shape has the\nbest of both worlds, being slightly intimidating,\nbut not enough to invoke feelings of an RBF.\nTo determine the aesthetic structure and shape\nof the eyebrows while also taking into account\nthe gender differences, a clinical trial was\nperformed by taking pictures of 40 subjects\nin five different poses.\nThe aim of using photographs with different\nposes was to evaluate the aesthetics of eyebrow\nmobility as well as the resting eyebrow.\nAccording to this clinical trial, women preferred\na lower eyebrow, with the starting structure\nbeing just under the orbital rim.\nThey preferred an accentuated, yet low -brow\npeak that is just medial to or right above\nthe lateral edge of the eye, whereas men preferred\na lower eyebrow with a less accentuated brow\npeak, again supporting the previous findings.\nThere weren’t many differences between what\neither of the genders preferred apart from\nthe height of the brow peak.\nHowever, there was a difference in the thickness\nof the brows with men generally favoring thicker\nand bushier brows on themselves.\nEven when women choose to have bushy eyebrows,\nthey are still groomed to be thinner and flatter\nto fit into the sexual dimorphic features\nof the brow.\nFor western standards, Margot Robbie is closest\nto the ideal brow shape for women, being downward\ntilted to not seem overly placid but with\na highly emphasised arch at the very edge\nof the eyes for feminine character.\nFor men, I’d say that male model Mariano\nDi Vaio is very close to ideal, with his brows\nbeing very full and dark which is arguably\nthe most important aspect for men as the brows\nare a function of eye shape and so if your\nperiocular region is weak and lacking brow\nsupport, then it doesn’t matter how good\nyour brows are, as they’ll never be wide\nenough to change your look significantly.\nYou can change the darkness and density to\nincrease facial masculinity which is why Mariano\nis a good example of how dark facial hair\nframes the face for men.\nFor women, colour is less important than the\npositioning.\nIf you like aesthetics based research, subscribe\nto the channel and check out our instagram\nwhere we put out morphs of different faces\nto illustrate

I’ve\npartnered up with Surfshark VPN because in\ndoing research for every video our team comes\nacross a certain problem that’s common in\nacademia, region locked articles.\nFor whatever reason, some articles, especially\nthe more niche research papers are region\nlocked to a specific country or exclude others.\nSurfshark allows you to virtually change your\nlocation to unblock content Most of you know\nwhat a VPN does, whether it be to obscure\nonline your identity and avoid pesky ads that\nfollow you around the web or to watch Netflix\nshows before they come to your region Surfshark,\nmuch like all VPNs, offers you the ability\nto access the internet as if you were in another\ncountry.\nUnlike the competitors, they’re a lot cheaper,\nallowing you to use one account for an unlimited\nnumber of devices which is fantastic value.\nFor us, this means moving from Australia to\nVietnam where for some odd reason, the subscription\nto research publishers is 50% cheaper after\nconversion and for you it might mean watching\nthe latest episode of a show directly from\nNetflix US.\nYou can use our code QOVES for 84% off with\nan extra 4 months for free and look, if you\nfeel like it’s not for you, then there’s\na 30 day money back guarantee, no questions\nasked.\nSupport the brands that support us by paying\nthem a visit, link in the description.\nBack to distraction osteogenesis, the procedure\nbegins with the cutting of bone after which\na distractor device is placed in between the\ntwo cut edges and the bone is allowed to heal\nnaturally on both ends.\nOrthopedic surgeons quite literally 100 years\nago knew of the possibility of this outlandish\nbut logical procedure working but they didn’t\nknow how much to lengthen by or how to encourage\nbetter growth.\nUsing intramedullary rods to correct fractures\nand bone deformities is standard procedure\nfor most orthopedic surgeons but these are\nmore focused around the limbs and not the\nface.\nThe technology and research isn’t new, but\nits application in tiny facial bones is an\nentirely different game of risks.\nBefore the bone starts to heal, the device\nis activated and it starts pulling the bones\naway at around 1mm or less per day to mimic\nnatural growth rates during puberty.\nThis allows for new bone callus to fill the\ndistance between the cut edges, hence elongating\na shorter bone.\nThis bone comes back stronger and thicker,\nmuch like muscles at the gym, which isn’t\nnoticeable on your limbs but could be unsightly\non the face.\nThe surgery itself is commonly reserved for\nsevere cases of oral and maxillofacial surgery,\nespecially for jaw deformities.\nIn fact, a retrospective analysis[ of 13 subjects\nwith micrognathia (a malformation where the\nlower jaw basically doesn’t grow at all)\nwho underwent distraction osteogenesis showed\nthat 10 out of 13 subjects achieved correct\ndistractor placement and final mandibular\nposition.\nIn other words it was successful.\nIn more severe cases like these, placing an\nimplant won’t magically correct for a large\nchunk of missing bone.\nThe osteogenesis procedure has been performed\nfor years as it has a high success rate in\ntreating deformities like craniosynostosis\nwhere a baby’s skull fuses too quickly,\ncausing the brain to push against it and make\nit mishapen.\nAccording to the Indian dental academy, osteogenesis\nis used in 6 cases.\nFor aesthetics, we’re concerned with the\nfirst two, but all 6 have the general theme\nof closing gaps in the bone.\n1.\nTo lengthen the mandible\n2.\nTo advance the maxilla / midface\n3.\nBone segment transportation\n4.\nTrifocal distraction\n5.\nDistraction for alveolar augmentation\n6.\nDistraction implantology\nThe type of tools that are most commonly used\nby maxillofacial surgeons to improve midface\ngrowth are either internal or external fixators.\nThey anchor to a stable part of the skull\nand apply very slow mechanical traction to\nredirect the forward growth, but as you can\nimagine, this stretches muscles, skin, bone\nand nerve tissue all the same.\nWhile the bone, muscles and skin can handle\nit, nerve tissue is much more temperamental\nand excessive friction can cause function\nloss altogether.\nWith the face being absolutely packed with\nnerves, this is no easy ordeal and having\nthis temporarily attached during distraction,\nis a special type of hell.\nThis rules out the procedure being viable\nfor cosmetic surgery as no doctor would take\nthat kind of liability for a perfectly healthy\nface that wants a minor improvement.\nHowever, with better internal fixators, the\nprocess could become more tolerable and thus\nreduce the threshold for what a doctor would\nconsider acceptable to operate on.\nSo how do these internal fixators work?\nThe first known cases of internal use were\nin 1993 and since then, they’ve delivered\nsome truly miraculous results to faces with\nno other hope.\nThis particular version uses biodegradable\nbase plates reducing the need for a more invasive\noperation when it comes time for removal.\nThis is a very simple version that still has\na screwhole for the key to go in and turn\nthe screw daily.\nWhat we’re expecting to come out in the\nfuture are electromagnetic distractors that\ndo not rely on mechanical turns of the screw,\nbut rather on electromagnetic pulses to turn\ntiny gears with astronomically high gear ratios\nwhich turns a small amount of force into a\nbig enough one that can physically remodel\nbone.\nThis way, your face is fully sealed off and\napart from tiny scars on the surface as its\nburied deep in the face.\nIn a comparative clinical study performed\nby doctors at UCLA medical center and Temple\nUniversity Hospital, the researchers compared\ntwo equally divided groups, one of which had\nundergone midface advancement using internal\ndistractors while the other one had undergone\nthe same procedure using external distractors.\nBoth groups were analyzed and it was found\nthat the facial appearance, distraction length,\nand functionality were all scored the same\nfor both groups.\nHowever, scores for quality of life as in\ndental anxiety, social function, and so on\nwere remarkably higher for internal devices\nthan external devices, which is the whole\npoint of this video.\nBasically speaking, patients had a higher\nrate of satisfaction with internal devices\nthan external devices.\nThe point of this video wasn’t to cover\na medical degrees worth of distraction osteogenesis\ntechniques in 10 minutes.\nInstead it shows an appreciation for what\naesthetic medicine is capable of, where technology\nis facilitating the normalization of surgery,\nwhether for functional or cosmetic reasons.\nThe only real way of changing your bone structure\nafter it's done growing is with tractional\nforce, whether it be with braces in conventional\northodontics, or with fixators to build new\nbone as we’ve covered.\nOsteogenesis over the years has been applied\nto clavicles to make the shoulders wider,\narms and legs to correct length asymmetries,\nand now faces to correct everything from the\ntop down.\nAs the tools improve, what was once a radical\nsurgery will slowly become normalized and\nmore bearable on its patients.\nWhat was once done for the worst of cases\nmay even be performed for cosmetic reasons\nbecause the risks will have been greatly reduced\nover-time.\nAs it turns out, it is possible to change\nthe once unchangeable parts of your face,\nbut it wont come easy or cheap just yet."}]}

This fact can be beneficial to \njust about everyone as although not every factor  \nthat determines beauty is modifiable, we can \ndefinitely alter our facial expressions to go  \nup the attractiveness ladder, and I’m not talking \nabout your run of the mill Buzzfeed advice,  \njust smile more. Depending on how attractive \nyou are, smiling less and appearing aloof  \nmay actually have a better effect as the \nresearch shows but more on that in a bit.\n  \n \nFrom Sutherland, Young and Rhodes’ 2017 \npaper, we know that a positive expression,  \nlike a smile, increases the attractiveness of \nthe person and makes them seem more trustworthy,  \nregardless of the true intentions of that \nperson. What you may not know however, is  \nthat a neutral facial expression performs almost \nas well, and in reality, smiling only produces  \na small benefit if any. Smiling when you’re \nsignificantly below average, will still lift your  \nspirits which is beneficial, but it won’t incline \nothers to feel any more positively about you  \nor treat you differently, despite what feel-good \narticles tell you. From the results, angry or  \nscowling faces were seen as more dominant which \nis expected, but again, neutral faces performed a  \nvery close second. Appearing dominant facially, \nis very important for men who are constantly  \ncompeting with each other, especially at work. \nHaving a permanently angry facial expression won’t  \nearn you more respect in the workplace if you’re \nsmall and unintimidating, but sometimes having a  \nneutral, reactionless expression is actually \nmore genuine and attractive. You do not need  \nto be smiling all the time to appear attractive, \nneutral expressions can work just as well,  \nespecially for the less attractive faces.  \nOn the corollary it introduces another question,  \nhow big of a benefit are your facial expressions \nto average or even unattractive faces? As it  \nturns out, not much. In last week’s video we \nlooked at Angrilli Et al’s paper where negative  \nexpressions of anger were seen as attractive on \nalready facially attractive faces. When someone  \nyou have a crush on reacts poorly with the waiter \nserving your food, you tend to miss the red flags.  \nWhen it’s someone you’re not attracted to, the \nauthors suggested that it has the opposite effect  \nwhere you block it out or even react negatively \nyourself. From Lindeberg et al’s 2019 paper,  \n“a happy face advantage emerged for the attractive \nfemales but not for the unattractive females,  \nCorresponding results were only found in the error \nrates for male faces.” Smiles are a multiplier for  \nattractiveness, and it does not work additively. \nMainstream advice that tells you otherwise and  \nto just smile more, is a bandaid solution that \nfails to acknowledge the pretty privilege bias  \nthat’s inherent in all of us. As for the happy \nface advantage, it refers to a happy face being  \nrecognised as happy faster than an angry one \nas angry. This ability to perceive emotions on  \nattractive faces faster is what gives them their \nadvantage in being able to command extra attention  \nfrom others. From the findings, faces rated from \na 1-7 likert scale showed a much bigger change for  \nthe attractive faces when going from negative to \npositive emotions than for the unattractive ones.  \nAs a channel and brand, we’ve always strived \nto provide research and advice for people of  \nall attractiveness ranges, rather than general \nadvice that only works for attractive people.  \nWhile smiling will boost your attractiveness, \nif you don’t feel like it or it’s not genuine,  \ndo not feel pressured to do so.\nSo this begs the question why do we put on this  \nfake smile? In the Anglosphere, the main reason \nis cultural. Smiling is an important social cue  \nthat conveys relatability and understanding. When \nyour date cracks an off-colour joke, you smile to  \nease the tension. When meeting someone for the \nfirst time, you smile to indicate that you’re  \ntrustworthy and warm. This form of in-authentic \ncommunication is not the same everywhere.  \nIn Eastern Europe, smiling is less common with \nthe saying “laughing for no reason is a sign of  \nfoolishness,” but that doesn’t mean that they’re \nunhappy, it’s just a cultural difference.\n \nFor photos we often give it a big cheesy smile \nto imitate the feeling of having a good time,  \nbut if you’re actually having a good time, \nwhy would you need to be asked to pose a  \nsmile? Different people express happiness or more \nimportantly comfort in their own skin in different  \nways. The issue isn’t with smiling per say, but \nbeing told ‘you would look prettier if you smiled  \nmore’ is incredibly frustrating because some \nfaces and aesthetics look better when serious,  \nespecially in print and photography. Photographers \nin the modelling industry understand this very  \nwell. For couture runways shows the atmosphere \nis serious and the models have a neutral to stern  \npose to appear aloof and indifferent. We covered \na similar concept in our Instagram vs Reality  \nspecial on the Kardashians, the Kardashian effect, \nwhere the entire clan poses in the same stern,  \ngreater than thou way, to sell their exclusivity \nand worth. In contrast, for something more fun  \nand playful like Victorias Secret, the atmosphere \nis much more relaxed with live performances and  \nsmiles all around to bring the audience in, the \nfocus isn’t on the product but the personality  \nthat the product brings. When the research says \nthat a smile is used to convey trustworthiness,  \nit really means to bring the receiver in. When \nyou don’t smile, it’s cold and standoffish,  \ncreating an us vs them mentality. Both can \ncreate attraction and both can be attractive  \nin their own rights, but one suits a certain face \ntype and aesthetic more than the other. \n \nIn general, people connect to other people whose \nemotions they can understand, and the easiest  \nemotion to understand is happiness. While our \ninitial questions were on smiling and attraction,  \nbeing happy in general is huge in preserving \nskin texture, which as we’ve covered in our  \nother videos, influences attractiveness.\nStudies have found that emotion can affect  \na person’s skin texture and composition by \nlowering the amount of collagen and elastin.  \nLoss of these vital skin proteins can make a \nperson prone to develop unattractive facial lines,  \nand early onset wrinkles. A chronically angry or \nunhappy face is often clearly distinguishable from  \nmultiple visible and permanent changes on the face \nas these people tend to develop baggy under eyes,  \nfrown lines between the eyebrows, and even crows \nfeet under the eyes. These lines are a consequence  \nof decreased protein and certain repeated facial \nexpressions such as squinting of the eyes,  \nfrowning and pursing of the lips. Being \nmindful of your expressions and mental state  \nwill keep your skin smoother in the long run.\nAlso those suffering from depression people tend  \nto be obese due to their habit of consuming sugar \nrich diet to experience a temporary surge in  \ndopamine. A study published in 1945 found a direct \ncorrelation between aging and consumption of sugar  \ndue to the formation of glycated collagen \nwhich accelerates the aging process of skin  \nleading to early onset wrinkle formation, saggy \nskin and an overall dull skin appearance. \n \nTo summarise. If you’re attractive, then smiling \na lot will benefit you more so than others. It’s a  \nlarger multiplier. However, having a neutral \nfacial expression is also not a bad thing.  \nWe often get emails from viewers complaining about \ntheir RBF and the issue isn’t in the face itself,  \nbecause to us it looks perfectly normal, but \ninstead it’s in how the anglosphere interprets  \nneutral expression as negative. We’re encouraged \nto smile as a tool of non-verbal communication  \nin the same vain that we open conversations with \n‘how are you’ or ‘gday how ya doin.’ Some faces do  \nlook better with a stern or serious expression \nwhile others benefit more from a smile. People  \nwith puffy cheeks feel conscious about smiling as \nit makes the fake look overly round. Those with  \nlean cheeks prefer to smile more to emphasise \ntheir strong lower third. Smiling is just one  \nof the many facial expressions possible, \nbut it isn’t the best pose for every face.  \nBeing happy on the other hand, is necessary to \nkeep your skin and health in check for longer."}]}

have narrowed with the\nrequirements for ideal beauty\nbecoming increasingly constricted to\nunderstand these changes\nit is best to look at not just how the\nstandards of beauty have changed\nbut what they were initially especially\nwhen you consider that the indian\ncivilization\nwere one of the first ones in existence\nthe earliest images of female figures in\nindia\nrepresented women with large breasts\nwide hips and tapering legs\nwomen in these images were described as\nbeing stiff\nbut only half a century later still\nduring the songha period\nimages of women showed bodies contorted\ninto an s shape\nfor increased eroticism these depictions\nare very close to the fertility idols\nseen around the world\nat different points in an emerging\ncivilization's history\nwhich unsurprisingly draws a link to the\nhourglass figure\nbeing a timelessly desirable trait which\nstill shows up\nin postmodern forms it's a universal or\nbiological standard of femininity rather\nthan a cultural one\nbecause these regions are heavily\ninfluenced by estrogen\nthe s-shaped curve had become the beauty\nstandard during the koshan period\nnow compare this depiction from the\najanta caves to the earlier drawings\nwhere the pre-4th century bc artists\nfocused on symbolizing\nfeminine beauty standards the more\ncontemporary ones focused on accurately\ndepicting it\nwith proportion scale and dimorphism\nhere the postures are more relaxed\ncandid portraits with a greater focus\non grace and slenderness what's more\ninteresting to me\nare the stylistic choices used for her\nface

seen time and time again in both\nclassic and contemporary works with\nwomen having a stray but\nsharp nose with a low nasolabial angle\nand a relatively neutral tip what is not\nseen\nin any of these drawings even the first\ncentury ad ones\nis the presence of a convex nasal\ncontour\ndue to a prominent dorsal hump while\nhook noses or aqualine noses\nmay look good on certain faces\nespecially men more so than women\nthe indian beauty standards do not seem\nto agree with it for their\nfaces for the last 2 000 or so years\nsomething that i've also found strange\nabout this indian sculpture\nis how aryan the facial features\nactually are\nwhile india at the time had a large\nimmigrant aryan population\nfrom 1500 bc and earlier it makes sense\nwhen you compare the two figures\nboth three-quarter turns but very\ndifferent faces\nthat's because this figurine is from the\ngandara region\nclose to the peshwa region in pakistan\nwhereas the first\nis from the janta caves deep in central\nindia\nwith the world being much smaller back\nthen that large of a distance\nmight as well be from here to the moon\nas robert bracey's essay on\nwomen in kushnine history stipulates\ngandaran artists are representing\neveryday indian women whereas the indian\nartists are not representing a\nparticular woman\nbut a symbolic representation of women\nin general\nsuch as in creating a divine idol\nfrom crib and ernington's 1992 essay on\nancient india and iran they believed the\nbeauty ideal\nto lie in the gandaran representations\nrather than the indian ones\nwith the more aryan features likely\nbecause of the familiarity model\nbecause people tend to like the looks of\nwhatever they're more exposed to\nbut we'll cut short the information\noverload there for

of\nfamiliarizing the world with\nindian ethnic features it has a\nselection bias issue\nwhere the majority of those being\nrepresented\ntended to have fairer skin caucasian\nfeatures\nrepresentative

skin tone\nquote unquote as many south asians\nunfortunately still believe\nexists there are better resources on the\ntopic and it already has\na lot of coverage a further study by\nunakrishnan in 2016\nattempted to answer important questions\non how these beauty standards\naffect the south indian population a\nquestionnaire was delivered to 333\nparticipants\nranging from women 15 to 34 years of age\nand the authors hypothesized that women\nless than 25 years old\nwere more influenced due to the\npressures of the pre-globalization era\ncompared to women who are older than 25\nunsurprisingly\ntheir results did agree with their\nhypothesis women who were concerned\nabout their appearance based on their\nbody features\nwere 11 percent less likely to\nappreciate\nthe standard south indian features the\nmost common body shape in the study for\nthe women\nwere found to be a mix of the pear and\nknee hourglass shapes\nand these findings actually agree with\nwhat we've seen in the art and\nliterature\nfrom the 400 bc figures we saw at the\nbeginning of the video\nalso women who were concerned about\ntheir skin complexion\nand felt confident only when they looked\none shade lighter\nwere 13 less likely to appreciate\nstandard south indian features\nand an overwhelming percentage of these\nwomen were under 25 years of age\nthe other subset in the group of older\nwomen were 66\nmore likely to be satisfied with their\nbody and facial features\nthat they were given this clearly shows\nthat globalization\nis not able to influence older south\nindian women as much as the younger ones\nand it could be that the existing beauty\nstandard is a result of 21st century\nculture\nand not a universal standard as we saw\nin the past\nand lastly from the study women who\nagreed to beauty enhancements\nwere 22 percent more likely to attribute\ntheir desire to look better\nto celebrities and pop culture now\ngranted that the study\ndoes have a few limitations in that\nthey're looking at south indians who are\ntraditionally darker skinned\nand northernmost regions of the entire\nsubcontinent\nwere typically of lighter-skinned\nethnicities may have\ncompletely different aesthetic\npriorities so to understand\nhow much of this is actually culture and\nhow much is universal\nwe have to look at another study chitra\nand prasanna\nlooked at the perception of facial\nattractiveness in the indian population\namong different groups facial profiles\nwere generated for both\nmale and female subjects and software\nwas used to create eight different\nmorphed profiles five different groups\nof raiders were asked to choose the most\nto least attractive profiles\nfrom 1 to 8. the results demonstrated\nthat regardless of the type of radar\n70 of the males and 57 percent of the\nfemales\npreferred straight normally developed\nprofiles\nthe least attractive profiles were those\nwith jaw misalignment\nsuch as retrognathic maxillas and\nprognathic mandibles\nthe study does have some noteworthy\nresults\nit shows that having proper jaw\nalignment is a universal characteristic\nand it's something that we obviously\ncovered on the channel in a much earlier\nvideo\nunder the same perspective it signals\nproper facial growth\nand genetic health so it only makes\nsense that we would want to avoid\nmedically classified deformities\nregardless of region\nbeauty standards that apply to other\nparts of the world overlap with\nsouth asian beauty standards and the\nonly real point of difference\nthis region has shown

Reality Ep. 12"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It’s been a while, but today we’re covering\nInstagram Vs Reality to brush up on your Photoshop\nskills and expose badly done frauds.\nToday’s set of photos come from the r/instagramreality\nsubreddit and as always, these videos are\nmeant to be informative and fun and are not\ntargeted at harming or injuring anyone’s\nbrand.\nFirst up is this very easy to spot example\nof body morphing.\nThe back story being that girls on Instagram\nare using it as body motivation.\nPerhaps they haven’t spotted the very clearly\nbent lines that come about as a result of\nusing the liquify tool on Photoshop or a similar\ndistortion tool in facetune.\nThe real red flag for me in this video is\nwondering how her jeans stay up with no belt.\nThere’s one method of cinching the belt\nloops together at the back which I’ve seen\nin modelling shoots where they send a one\nsize fits all piece of clothing and have it\nmatch the model’s frame but that’s obviously\nnot the case here as they hang loose.\nMoving on, Massimo seems to have forgotten\nhe was standing in front of a busy background.\nWhat I love about this image is that the tiles\nact as a very close representation of the\ntransformation map formed when using the liquify\ntool.\nTransformation maps like these are used to\ntell the computer how to distort pixels when\na liquify brush is applied.\nAt these regions the lines concave inwards,\nindicating he’s sucked his waist in, but\nyou don’t even need visual proof like this\nto tell if a body is edited, you need to understand\nthe limits of human proportion.\nI’ve used this example in a previous episode,\nbut former IFBB body builder Brian Buchannen\nwas known for having some of the narrowest\nhips in the league.\nUnless you’re a one in a million case with\nexceptionally gifted genetics such as him,\nchances are there’s something strange going\non in the picture.\nAlso, notice how in Brian’s proportions\nhis waist and hips are nearly the same size.\nThis is the bone structure for most men, and\nI’ll use Ronaldo’s extremely lean physique\nas another example of the upper limits of\nwhat’s possible, his waist to hip ratio\nis 1:1.\nIf anything the waist on most men is wider\nthan their hips as belly fat pushes it out,\nhowever in this photo it’s the opposite\nmaking him look like he has child-bearing\nhips.\nThere are rare cases where men have wider\nhips than waists due to unfortunate genetics,\nbut for someone to photoshop their physique\ninto the unideal shape is just odd.\nLastly, no one ever stops at just one edit,\nso by looking around you’ll see distortions\nat his deltoids and biceps too.\nThis photo is a perfect visual representation\nof all the things i’d look for, or all the\nthings i’d avoid as a Photoshop Editor.\nHere we have a budget Kardashian.\nFrom the video taken of her by someone else,\nher waist isn't as thin as she makes it out\nto be in her photos.\nThere’s nothing wrong with that, but when\nyou profit off of selling impossible goals\nto impressionable teens, it’s a bit problematic.\nSo lets break this image down.\nHer shadow is clearly visible behind her suggesting\nthat the light source, in this case the sun,\nis in our direction, the viewer.\nUnless she’s in a football stadium with\nmultiple spotlights on her, there shouldn’t\nbe a second shadow as we can see here, especially\none that contours to her waist.\nThis second shadow is from the window sill\nand it’s very easy to see how each gradient\nof shadow contours in exactly the same way\ntowards her waist, pointing to the obvious\nculprit of a liquify or facetune brush.\nThe fact that her edit disturbed every gradient\nof the shadow rather than just the main one\nindicates that she used a brush too big for\nthe job and overall it’s a sloppy job.\nA professional edit would involve cutting\nout her outline and implanting the original\nwall back in so that it looks undisturbed.\nAs for the rest of the face it’s difficult\nto tell what’s makeup and what’s photoshop\nas she hasn’t changed a whole lot, so we’ll\nleave it at that.\nIn this next photo, we have Kylie and believe\nit or not, Caitlyn Jenner.\nIt’s really hard to find accurate photos\nof what Caitlyn actually looks like at 70\nbecause the large majority are edited like\nthis.\nFrom this interview shot her skin shows heavy\nnasolabial and nasojugal lines, finer undereye\nlines and considerable skin sag at her eyebrows\nand cheeks.\nAlso, in this shot her skin is very pale and\npasty whereas in the edit with Kylie their\nskin tones match and shes gained an instant\ntan.\nI have to give credit to her editor for leaving\nsome creases and fine details for realism,\nbut the biggest giveaway is the colour disparity\nbetween the face and neck where Kylie’s\nnatural neck is the same tone as her face\nand Caitlyn’s is a few shades darker.\nIt’s strange to me that she or whoever her\neditor is would overedit the face past what\nthe general media is used to seeing.\nHere’s a similar example of turning back\n40 or so odd years.\nIt’s quite clear to see how the wrinkles\nwere edited when looking at the sharp change\nin skin tone at the forehead.\nThis is caused by using a patch tool or something\nsimilar that samples a desirable portion of\nthe skin to replace an undesirable one.\nUnless you’re constantly changing where\nyou’re sampling the skin from, simply dragging\nthe tool across and being lazy will result\nin only one skin tone being copied over rather\nthan a range which is what you’re seeing\nhere; only two.\nLeaving in uneven complexion may be seen as\na flaw but it’s also what makes us human\nand realistic.\nHere’s a better example from a dodgy skincare\nad on Instagram.\nNot only does their miracle cream make your\nnose straighter but it also blurs your face\nand makes it all one skin tone.\nThis is one just ridiculous.\nIt’s so ridiculous, I’m still going to\ntalk about it.\nYou can see her obliques and then the separation\nas we move into her rectus abdominis which\nis this region here.\nSo where is her other set of oblique muscles?\nThis image seems odd because she only edited\none side, and even then she overdid it.\nAnother sign is that the shadow behind her\ncontours to her waist when the light source\nis in front of her.\nLastly, if you zoom into the shadow and the\nwaist, they both have pixel shear as the skin\ncoloured pixels from her body blend with the\npitch black shadow.\nThis is seen when you stretch them too far\nwith the liquify tool.\nIf Sylvester Stallone wasn’t 73, i’d be\nconvinced this is him.\nHis Adobe gains have managed to bend the spacetime\ncontinuum and it’s clear to see he’s worked\non his delts, with one being larger than the\nother.\nHis left arm has quite a busy background,\nso if he did change anything there, it would\nbe really noticeable.\nNot to mention right his delt has a random\nbump in it’s contour, which you wouldn’t\nexpect from cannonball sized muscles.\nEdits like this always confuse me.\nThere’s something definitely unique with\nbeing 70% legs and 7’2” with the proportions\nof a 5’8” girl but I genuinely don’t\nknow how these edits are done.\nA lot of users have sent me footage of chinese\nediting apps that make the legs long and slender\nbut the fact that it can do it in real time\nwithout disrupting the background is miles\nahead of any technology the public has on\nthe western market.\nUpdate: so after recording this video I did\nsome more research and found a great video\nby a Youtuber called Asian Woes who basically\nstretches the bottom half of the image with\nthe legs to elongate them.\nThe effect is very subtle and I’m honestly\nsurprised how easy it is.\nThat being said, I don’t think that’s\nwhat’s happened here.\nIf you look at the sky it’s very clearly\nan artistic edit because of how defined the\nline between the background and foreground\nare.\nWhoever edited this photo be it her or someone\nelse would likely go to the more painstaking\ntrouble of cutting her out and stretching\nthe photo manually but that’s a lot of work.\nWe’ll end it there for this episode as the\nremaining honorable mentions are just more\nof the same thing.\nFollow our instagram page @qovesstudio to\nsee more celebrity facial morphs and edits.\nIf you would like for us to edit your own\nphotos in a more responsible and accurate\nway you can go over to our site at qoves.com\nand contact us."}]}

Ep. 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tiktok, formerly known as Music.ly, has become\nan incredibly popular form of social media\nfor its relatability and authenticity.\nLike all great things, it has its fair share\nof controversy and opaqueness.\nReddit’s CEO Steve Huffman and Facebook’s\nSheryl Sandberg both have their doubts with\nhow the app stores and uses user data, with\nthe US government even opening a national\nsecurity investigation into it.\nPart of this fear stems from how shrouded\nBytedance, the parent company of Tiktok, is\nwith their methods.\nWith the amount of money, exposure and fame\ntied to making it big on the app, it’s more\nimportant than ever to really understand how\nvirality algorithms actually work.\nI recently came across a brilliant video on\nmy feed by the user @Benthamite looking into\nTiktok’s supposed beauty algorithm.\nIn his clip he proposes that Tiktok rates\nvideos for potential success based on the\nattractiveness of those in it.\nHe also suggests a paper by Xie Et al on developing\nan algorithm to assess human beauty.\nAlgorithms to assess human beauty are nothing\nnew.\nThere are multiple from different Chinese\nuniversities all using the same dataset and\nbuilding upon each other to produce more refined\nalgorithms.\nFor years, machine learning algorithms have\nbeen able to be trained by humans to differentiate\nbetween attractive and unattractive.\nIt’s something humans can do incredibly\neasily because it takes up a relatively large,\nprimal portion of our brain called the Fusiform\nFace Area.\nWe’re so good at it we rate faces in inanimate\nobjects, aka Pareidolia.\nFor a machine however, pictures of faces are\njust pixels.\nFacial recognition was achieved in the early\n2000’s and typically use Histograms of Oriented\nGradients (HOG) where the processor detects\nsharp differences in pixel values as a facial\noutline or feature.\nThis creates a bounding box that eliminates\nthe useless background and saves on memory\nusage enough such that your phone can even\ndo it in realtime.\nHow does this relate back to Tiktok?\nWith a basic understanding of how computers\nsee faces, lets look at how scientists or\nmore correctly, anthropometrists, the researchers\nwho measure differences across ethnicities,\nsee faces.\nIn the exact same way actually.\nIt’s easy to see how identifying certain\nlandmarks of the face, such as say nose width\n(alar base width) or forehead inclination,\nyou can assess how far their measurements\ndeviate from the average for their race.\nAs explained in virtually every video, averageness\nor Koinophillia is one of the four fundamental\ntraits for attractive faces.\nIn fact, using these landmarks, forensic anatomists\ncan actually predict the ethnicity of deceased\nremains, which I’ll cover in a future video.\nBy allowing the algorithm to measure and then\nevaluate the degree of fit with these ideal\naverages, it can provide a ‘beauty score.’\nA human can then evaluate if this result is\naccurate or not or how accurate the bounding\nbox was at selecting the face, and the machine\ncan tune it’s parameters and try again.\nThis is the basis of facial machine learning.\nWith Bytedance being based in a country with\nabundant labour and now plentiful user data,\nit’s no surprise that their proprietary\nalgorithm would be very accurate at picking\nwinners.\nTiktok’s algorithm is expected to work in\na similar way.\nYou give it a 2D input, it takes the geometric\nfeatures of the face, compares them to anthropometric\nideals.\nIt also samples skin texture at points that\nmost people have blemishes or irregularities\nin and provides a combined score of the two.\nHowever, instead of using a human rater to\ntrain it, it uses a deep learning neural network,\nwhere you identify a few top level features\nof a pretty face and let the computer associate\nsimilar aspects it thinks might matter as\nit works its way down.\nBenthamite from Tiktok, has actually uploaded\na similar algorithm which he found online\non TiktokBeautiful.com.\nUsing computer generated images from thispersondoesnotexist.com\nit gave a tight range of scores from 2.5 to\n3.5 out of 5, which is to be expected because\nthat’s where the bell curve of attractiveness\nlies for most people.\nOnly 1 in a 100 or so would actually get a\n4 or 5.\nI’d agree with the ratings and say they’re\npretty accurate.\nIn Benthamite’s video he argued that the\nstudy is based on white and asian faces which\nis also true and fails to account for darker\nskin tones.\nThis is likely because of the skin sampling\nportion of the score where darker skin has\na greater range of contrast that the algorithm\npenalizes.\nAlso more obviously, the system isn’t trained\nwith African anthropometric values so it’s\ncomparing them to Caucasian and Asian ones.\nAfter reaching out to him, he confirmed it\nused the neural network one proposed in the\npaper which uses a number of feature maps\ntaken from attractive faces and compares how\nyour face is different to it.\nWhat surprised me about the algorithm is the\nability to measure skin smoothness and health.\nIn a previous video I covered the scientific\nimportance of healthy skin and Xie Et al’s\nalgorithm does a pretty good job of identifying\nit.\nThis lady has deep nasolabial folds and uneven\ntones near her paranasal which rated considerably\nlower than this young girl with very even\ntone and virtually no age related lines.\nMoving back to Tiktok, it’s not clear how\nor how strongly this beauty score affects\nvideo popularity.\nI’d guess that much like Youtube’s algorithm,\nwhen you upload a video, the machine learning\nprocess looks at a number of parameters, such\nas watch time, views, likes and comments in\na very short time frame, such as within the\nfirst 1 to 2 hours.\nVideos with a greater momentary click through\nrate and engagement, are obviously catching\neyes and worth promoting to the trending page,\nor in Tiktok’s case, the for you page.\nBoth systems try to optimize viewership and\nonly promote high quality content, because\nviews equals money.\nIt’s likely that this beauty score acts\nas one of the parameters on top of the rest\nof watch time, views, etc and could help explain\nwhy everyone on your For You page appears\nto be so disproportionately pretty.\nAlso, these creators get greater views by\nvirtue of simply being eye candy, which the\nTiktok machine learning algorithm, overtime,\nwould recognise as ‘high quality content’.\nWhen so much of the platform is based on the\ncreator’s personality, being attractive\ndoes help them get their foot in the door."}]}

NBA basketball is in general tend to\nbe better looking than average because\nthey're high level athletes with very\nlow levels of body fat and in the case\nof male players higher testosterone from\nphysical activity and competition it's\nno surprise that the large majority of\nthem have strong job bodies sharp brow\nbones and high cheekbones these sexually\ndimorphic features come about through a\nhigher development or testosterone and\nare very closely interlinked with each\nother it's this perceived masculinity\nwhere most of their facial features lean\nheavily in the crude manliest I'd that\nsets Kelly Oubre apart from the rest of\nthe NBA lineup\nGruber a junior has been regarded as the\nmost handsome player in the league for a\nwhile now and there's a few reasons that\nset him apart in fact I'd argue that\nthere are three fundamentals to a\nconventionally attractive face\nproportion dimorphism and uniqueness\nstart off with the most obvious his jaw\nwidth is near one-to-one with his facial\nwidth if you've been watching this\nseries for a while now you come to\nrealize that a lot of the attractive men\nshown throughout have high by gonio to\nbuy zygomatic ratios this facial\ncharacteristic falls into number two\ndimorphism where large jaws are\nindicative of higher testosterone which\nour ancestors found attractive this is\nbecause it shows that the immune system\ncan take a higher range of stress that\ntestosterone typically places on it in\nemerg 2016 paper the study of the ideal\nmale jaw he proposed that the angle\nbetween the eye and the nose should be\nthe same as the jaw inclination or at\nleast within a 15 degree deviation in\nKelly's case his is near-perfect and\nit's worth noting that murmurs paper\nfound feminine jaws on men to be more\nattractive than\noverly masculine ones Kelly's is\nobviously more feminine whereas most men\nin the league have masculine ones hidden\nunder beard this gives him the pretty\nboy aesthetic that appeals to a younger\naudience\nin 1988 palette I looked at countless 3d\ntomography images and found that the\nmost prominent part of the cheekbone so\nthere's a coma can be determined by a\nfew construction lines here Kelly's\ncheekbones are high and far apart which\nis again a feminizing trait but it's\nstill considered attractive because of\nhow long and narrow his eyes are with a\nlot of men they can have the idea of\nfacial width to height ratio which if\nyou're new to the channel is as the name\nsuggests wider shorter faces are seen as\nmore aggressive and attractive but these\nmen also usually lack the correct I\nshape having rounded eyes on a wide face\nmakes them look beady and submissive\nalso by transverse proportions the\ndistance between the eyes and ears\nbecomes too large which isn't the case\nhere as Kelly has eyes that suit his\nwidth\nhis eyes are hooded by upper Perry\nocular fat which gives the appearance of\na strong brow burn but there's a caveat\nthat it also makes him look younger as\nthis is a juvenile trait nonetheless it\nreduces his upper eyelid exposure so the\npre tassel exposure we're back at all in\n2019 and that attractive eyes had lower\npre tall soldier than their unattractive\ncounterparts\nKelly is actually a good example of this\nbecause his lower exposure makes his\neyes appear more deep-set and mysterious\nand in terms of evolutionary biology\nit's been linked with having a greater\nfighting advantage but I guess being 6 7\nis quite good too and he is former\nbasketball or Marco jarek same height\nsame facial width but the eyes make a\nbig difference if they're not\nproportionate to the face now let's\naddress the elephant in the room being\nlight-skinned does give him an advantage\nin being unique being one of only a\nhandful of men in the league with his\ncomplexion does help him to stand out\nit's something that people are hyper\naware about but no one ever wants to\nacknowledge aka\naesthetic labor you can refer to these\ntwo videos on black models and\nleadership and attraction for more\ninformation on that\ntik-tok loves to drag on the\nlight-skinned Jayden's of the world\nespecially now\nbut in researching for this video one of\nthe most commonly liked features on\nKelly\nwere his eyes many people liked the\ncolor of them but I'd argued that it's\nnot the color that they like but how\nwell his eyes as a whole harmonized with\nthe face as I've just explained having\nuniquely colored eyes doesn't make up\nfor all the other peri ocular flaws on\nthis particular face\ndon't be gaslighted into thinking\nchanging eye colors would dramatically\nimprove aesthetic appeal harmony and\nproportion is much more important\noftentimes it has the opposite effect\nand a large majority of ocular implants\nget reversed for one reason or another\nKelly's current hair style also makes a\nbig difference this photo of young herb\nRey is very different to the one you\nknow now being above average tall makes\nfor an above average facial length and\nhaving hair that goes straight up leaves\nyou looking like a tiki mask carrot all\nfound that you're perceived attraction\nis more sensitive to the

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Video Title: Facial Symmetry and Asymmetry | What Makes A Face Attractive Ep. 8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the Evolutionary Psychology of Facial Beauty\nby Gillian Rhodes, a paper that’s cited\non the channel all the time, symmetry, averageness\nand sexual dimorphism are the three big indicators\nof attractiveness. In the defining beauty\n/ what makes a face attractive series, the\nepisodes put out so far talk cover just ⅓\nof this attractiveness trifecta, the averageness\npart. They discuss what the ideal values are\nby different races, genders and cephalometric\nregions and while we’ll continue putting\nout more videos on different parts of the\nface, it’s important to not neglect the\nother 2 important aspects to beauty.\nThe idea goes that symmetry indicates mate\nquality and strong genetic health. In her\npaper Rhodes cites that the likelihood of\nasymmetries in human bodies occuring increase\nwith inbreeding, premature birth, psychosis\nand mental retardation[a]. Further studies[b]\nfrom the late 20th century show that artificially\nmaking faces symmetric increases their attractiveness\nalthough their facial features remain the\nsame. On the other hand, asymmetry is equally\nundesirable in animals. There’s many biological\nreasons from a loss of genetic variance to\nheterozygosity but let's just say if a bird\nis born with asymmetrical wings, it’ll die\nvery quickly to natural selection. This type\nof example is due to fluctuating asymmetry\nas it’s individual specific.\nIt’s important to distinguish between the\ntwo types of symmetry:\nFluctuating refers to random deviations from\nperfect symmetry, e.g. nemo with his deformed\nflipper would die real quick if it wasn’t\na disney movie.\nDirectional symmetry is where there is a bias\ntowards one side, e.g. left and right handedness\nwith 85% being right handed. Directional symmetry\ncan be consistent across an entire population\nand so it doesn’t signal mate quality since\neveryone is the same and our perceptions adapt\nto where it becomes unnoticeable[c] unlike\nfluctuating.\nIt’s worth noting that In Symmetry and Human\nFacial Attractiveness by Perrett and colleagues\nit states that some degree of asymmetry may\nactually be desirable to make the individual\nmore expressive. During speech 76% make greater\nright handed gestures than left. Likewise\nWylie and Goodale 1988 found that spontaneous\nfacial expressions are more asymmetric than\nposed ones, but somehow found more attractive.\nIt’s sort of like how raising one eyebrow\nis seductive but raise both and you look like\na surprised barn owl.\nPerfect symmetry is near impossible to achieve.\nA small degree of bilateral asymmetry is to\nbe expected on every face, even our brains\nare asymmetric with left and right handedness.\nIt only becomes a problem when it’s blatantly\nnoticeable. Research by Peck Et[d] al found\nthat asymmetry is greatest in the jaw, so\nthe lower third and least in the cranium or\nthe upper third. Another study by Severt and\nProffit[e] recorded that only 5% of asymmetry\ncases were found in the upper third, 36% in\nthe midface and 75% in the lower third. Why\nis that?\nOne hypothesis that I’d like to throw out\nthere, is that our dentofacial growth is somewhat\ndetermined by our diets. This was also the\nconclusion of Canadian dentist, Dr Weston\nPrice, who compiled numerous data on how soft,\nWestern diets lead to misaligned tooth eruption.\nCould it be that the most kinetically active\npart of our face, the jaw, is most prone to\nasymmetry because it’s dependent on so many\nfactors for proper growth. The side you predominantly\nchew your food on will have more developed\nmasseter muscles than your weaker side, that’s\na common asymmetry. Conversely, the cranium\njust grows outwards, free from constant movement\nor external force so it’s much less prone\nto asymmetry. The midface is intermediate\nbecause it contains a lot of complex soft\ntissue structures like the eyes and nose so\nit’s easy to imagine how the cells might\nmess up duplication although they’re under\na lot less physical stress unlike the jaw.\nBut again, this is just my own personal conjecture.\nIn 1997 Moller and Thornhill found a weak\nbut significant correlation regarding the\nheritability of asymmetry, but it’s still\na hotly disputed topic. If asymmetry is truly\nheritable, then this theory I’ve proposed\ngoes out the window and you should just pick\nnew parents next time.\nAlthough the causes of asymmetry are endless,\nclinical scientists can break them up into\nthree categories:\n* Malformations: a morphological (shape) related\ndefect resulting from an abnormal development\nprocess\n* Deformation: a defect caused by getting\npunched in the face by sonny liston\n* Disruption: morphological defect caused\nby a breakdown in the development process\nThe most common way of assessing symmetry\nis with a bilateral flip where you take a\nface, cut it down the facial midline, typically\nthe philtrum and compare the two sides but\nif you’ve ever tried this for yourself with\nenough faces you’ll notice a few weaknesses\nin this method. Going back to G. Rhodes, she\ncalls out these limitations too and I paraphrase,\nin taking a hemispherical flip of a face,\na very slight tilt of the head or a slight\ndeviation from the front on view amplifies\nthe asymmetry in the resulting chimera image.\nIn other words, images appear abnormally wide\nor narrow and this greatly affects attractiveness\nresults.\nA better way is to blend the original face\nwith the flipped face to offset any angle\nor tilt errors in the original image which\nis how we now do it for every QOVES facial\nreport.\nIn the Perrett study I mentioned earlier,\nthey use a third method where they physically\nstraighten asymmetries using the 1999 equivalent\nof the liquify tool. Figures c) and d) are\nthe midline flips (chimera) while b) is the\nnew method of manually adjusting 224 facial\npoints for perfect symmetry.\nThere isn’t really much to say with bilateral\nsymmetry. It’s either noticeable or it isn't.\nGenerally the most noticeable asymmetries\nare in the eyes as we obviously look at that\nfirst on a face. This is seen as a deviation\nin the canthal tilt or the eyelid contour\nwhere ptosis causes the upper eyelid to droop\nlower than the other. From what I’ve seen,\nthe lower eyelid doesn’t seem to be as asymmetric\nas the upper.\nAfter the eyes we look to the nose because\nit’s also a large, salient part of the face.\nIn terms of bilateral asymmetry it’s usually\nin the nasal bridge where most people have\na crooked nose bridge that’s noticeable\nbecause the nose is dead center on the facial\nmidline. The nose base and nose tip aren’t\nas common because they’re smaller in the\ncase of the tip or further from the line in\nthe case of the nose alars.\nWhen assessing symmetry, especially for the\nnose and eyes it’s best to use what’s\nknown as transverse symmetry where horizontal\nreference lines are drawn to assess how well\nfacial features are spatially related. Ideally,\non a well formed face transverse lines should\nbe horizontal to the occlusal plane. The occlusal\nplane is the imaginary plane made by your\nupper and jaw coming together at rest. If\nfor whatever reason the maxilla or mandible\nis rotated or tilted this plane very clearly\ntilts too and is no longer parallel to the\ninterpupillary line. When this happens it’s\ncalled canting in dentistry and it’s clear\nto see from both views how it causes a noticeable\nasymmetry, even if you keep your lips sealed.\nThis is just the tip of the iceburg but there’s\nnumerous similar asymmetries, the majority\nof which occur in the jaw and lower third.\nHere is an example of lateral mandibular displacement\nwhere the lower jaw is very clearly misalligned\nand Chin asymmetry, where the jaw is aligned\nbut the chin isn’t.\nFor the majority of the people watching, these\nmore serious cosmetic and dentofacial defects\nlikely won’t apply to you. In all of the\nfacial reports the QOVES team has done so\nfar I don’t recall ever seeing any of these\nasymmetries we’ve just gone over.\nThese more serious defects create underlying\nbiomechanical issues and so they’re corrected\nearly on in the interest of health.\nAlthough we know asymmetry is undesirable\nfor attraction, science has been unable to\nproperly quantify what types of asymmetries\nare worse. Is a crooked nose worse than a\nmalformed jaw? Is a case of ptosis worse for\naesthetics than a maxillary cant? In 1993\nJones and Hill tried to quantify fluctuating\nasymmetry but produced a limited test of only\n6 traits. Also it lacked repeatability so\nit’s virtually unusable, but it did create\na foundation to jump off of. Grammar and Thornhill\nin 1994 devised a method by summing the offset\nof asymmetrical facial features from the facial\nmidline.\nFor most people, asymmetry is actually quite\neasy to correct. Fillers can help produce\na more even facial contour for example Botox\nin the eyebrows or forehead can raise one\nside to appear even. Another method is with\na rhinoplasty to straighten the nasal bridge,\nwhich is one of the more noticeable asymmetries.\nAs for the jaw, if it’s an underlying dentofacial\nalignment issue, implants aren’t going to\ndo you much good but if it’s a case of weak\ngrowth, then implants can go very far in correcting\nasymmetry, especially since they’re 3-D\nprinted to the client’s needs.\nAnd with that, we bring this episode to a\nclose. Hopefully you learned something, the\nidea is to make longer 10 minute videos moving\nforward to explore the concepts in greater\ndepth and clear up confusion. If you want\nus to test your facial symmetry and many other\nproportions, be sure to check out the QOVES\nfacial report.

with age by reducing the amount\nof fat needed with solid bone the eyes\nstay youthful for longer so it's really\na trade-off between higher testosterone\nwhich matures the face but at the same\ntime keeps it looking youthful for\nlonger now proportion wise without even\nmeasuring it it's very clear that Matt's\nface is very symmetric and balanced his\nfacial thirds are near-ideal with the\nupper third being slightly shorter as he\nages and his hairline pushes back this\nactually brings the appearance of the\nupper third more in line with the other\ntwo which is why he's aged so gracefully\ngenerally the people who age the best\nhave near ideal proportion in the middle\nand lower third so even without the hair\nthey still maintain harmony speaking of\nthe lower third his jaw

the\nexpected measures from the medial iris\nto mouth jaw inclination and transverse\nproportions which is expected because\nhis face is very harmonious to look at\nin the kilian episode\nKillians face didn't pass all the\nproportion measures especially the jaw\nand inter cantle width which is why\nKillians face is considered polarizing\nwhile math is just conventionally\nhandsome another

Makes A Face Attractive Ep. 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If there’s one facial stigma that gets more\nnegative responses than others, its prominent\nears or bat ears.\nThis class one abnormality is entirely cosmetic\nand isn’t serious enough to be life threatening\nand so makes for easy pickings without feeling\nguilt or pity, especially by children.\nChildren pay more attention than adults to\nsmall differences in appearance between themselves\nand others and so when they see someone with\nlarge, protruded ears, they become the butt\nof all jokes which has serious behavioural\neffects growing up.\nStudies show that.\nprotruding ears have been associated with\ninferior cognitive performance at school,\nimmaturity, less favorable personality traits,\ndiminished self-confidence, and social avoidance.\nChildren act out as a result of their facial\nfeatures without themselves understanding\nthe serious downward spiral at play.\nMeasuring the effect of corrective otoplasty\n(where the ear is pinned back) using tests,\nsuch as the Child Behavior Checklist, the\nState-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children,\nand the Children’s Depression Inventory,\nrevealed improvements in almost all the assessed\nitems after the procedure.\nIn the media they pick characters with protruded\nears to portray low intelligence.\nIn fact, large, prominent ears elicit more\nnegative reactions in both the patient and\nonlookers than any other feature.\nOne such reason could be that it affects only\n5% of the population with facial deformities,\nwhich itself is 10% of the total population.\nIn Germany it was estimated to be between\n1:2000 to 1:20000 births having an ear related\ndeformity.\nIt has a rarer occurrence and so it’s all\nthe more noticeable when someone does have\nit.\nIt’s unlike having a big nose, thin lips\nor a large forehead, because those features\nare more common in certain ethnicities than\nothers.\nNow Ear length and size does vary by ethnicity\nwith the Indian subcontinent having the largest\nand Afro Carribeans having the smallest, however,\nunless you’re a bat, protruded, outward\nturned ears are not a feature of any ethnicity\nand instead vary by individuals.\nProposed causes may include genetic factors,\npoint mutations, but also environmental influences\nduring pregnancy, such as exposure to X-rays,hypoxia,\nas well as the intake of certain drugs, such\nas thalidomide\nEar anatomy is defined by many different parameters\nbecause its such a unique and complex shape\nso we’ll go through them as they appear.\nProtruded ears have a combination of three\nmain features to them: 1) an increased helix\nmastoid angle which is the angle between the\nhelix or the top of the ear and the angle\nit forms with the head.\nThis causes more of the ear to be more exposed\nand rounded from a frontal view like a cartoon\nmonkey.\nSometimes even with a normal helix mastoid\nangle, the ear may still appear protruded\ndue to antihelical hypoplasia where the antihelical\nstructure isn’t fully formed to pin the\near back.\nThe antihelical structure is the part of the\near the curves backwards towards your head\nright at the end.\nWithout it, the ear curves outwards like a\nfleshy sound collecting bowl.\nResearch by Alexander Et al 2010 shows that\nan unfolded or incomplete antihelix accounts\nfor 73% of the ear’s prominence\nHypoplasia means incomplete development, Hyperplasia\nrefers to enlargement or over development.\nWhich leads us to the third way of defining\na protruded ear, cavum hyperplasia where an\noverdeveloped cavum curves the entire ear\nstructure and pushes the earlobe and helix\nout further, making them more prominent.\nIn contrast, a normally developed ear has\na distance of 6 -20mm from the helical rim\nand the head with a helix mastoid angle of\nless than 30 degrees.\nAs previously explained this angle is the\nangle between your ear’s external structure\nand the head, like a door hinge.\nHaving an ideal helical distance is then obviously\ndependent on having an ideal ear angle by\nsimple trigonometry.\nThese cutoffs were chosen by finding an acceptable\naverage from 100 adults and 50 children (Rubin\n1962).\nThere were no significant variations in prominence\nby gender or race in another study of 2300\nears although ear size and shapes do vary.\nAlso, the axis of the ear should be near parallel\nto the bridge of the nose and the auricle\nshould be approximately one auricular length\n(55-70mm) behind the lateral orbital margin.\nThe ear is an organ consisting of an internal\nand external structure and so auricle refers\nto the entire outer structure.\nLateral means towards the sides and orbital\nmargin means the perimeter of the orbital\nbone as explained in Episode 2.\nSo in other words the ear should be one ear\nwidth behind the eye socket.\nLastly, the ear width (auricle width) should\nbe 50-60% of the ear’s length (30-45mm width,\n55-70mm length)\nAesthetically speaking, is this an issue worth\ncorrecting?\nOne otoplasty paper suggests getting it corrected\nat the ages of 5-6 years before starting school\nto avoid the previously mentioned negative\npsychosocial traits associated with protruded\nears.\nAt that age, it’s known that children can\nconvey their dissatisfaction and often it’s\nthe parents who want the surgery done for\nthem.\nThe reality is, protruding ears are such a\npolarizing issue that the people who have\nthem either feel strongly enough to have them\ncorrected very early on or don’t bother\nto ever.\nResearch by Alexander Et al found that what\nthe researchers rated as ‘clinically’\nprominent were very rarely considered as prominent\nby the test subjects in both men and women.\nSo it might not be a big of a deal as you\nget older and ‘grow’ into them.\nThe likelihood is that the majority of the\npeople watching this video have anatomically\nregularly shaped ears.\nHow you feel about them beyond that is influenced\nby culture and beauty standards which is a\ndifferent topic.\nFor instance a modelling beauty standard encourages\na lower helix - mastoid angle to get a more\nswept back, high fashion look.\nIf prominent ears are considered unattractive,\nthen it would make sense that swept back ears\nwith a low helical angle would be conventionally\nattractive, regardless of the ear shape.\nSo this week, I put out a poll asking what\nvideo people wanted to see and the defining\nbeauty series won out overwhelmingly so that's\nwhy there’s back to back uploads this week.\nA couple of updates, we’re 2-3 days away\nfrom the launch of our Facial aesthetics report\ndepending on your timezone.\nThe report analyzes your face and applies\ncephalometric measurements, much like the\nones covered in this video on the ear, but\nfor every facial feature to help you make\nmore informed decisions.\nDepending on the tier you choose, they go\nmore or less in depth and we’ve really tried\nto price them so that they’re accessible\nto everyone but also balances our time and\nresources too.\nLastly, if you're new to the channel, do subscribe,\nwe’re almost at 100k.\nThere’s really interesting research coming\nout on how attractive faces can dilate our\nperception of time which we’ll be covering\nvery soon."}]}

taking a break this week\nbecause we just finished the tenth\nepisode and I think it's best to try\ndifferent content to avoid burning out\nI'm just tired of looking at bad liquify\nedits to be honest as per the top\ncomments in episode 1 we're breaking\ndown what facial features make Audrey\nHepburn Shawn Oprah and Aishwarya Rai\nconventionally attractive Audrey Hepburn\nborn\nAudrey Ruston was a prominent English\nactress and fashion icon during the 20th\ncentury during a period of time where\nfemininity was pursued and encouraged\nHepburn stood out for her unique\ncarefree style that arose as part of a\npost-war counterculture broadening the\ndefinition of what it means to be\nfeminine beautiful and fashionable in\nparticular she rocked a short-haired\npixie cut which accentuated her gamin\nplayful archetype on screen in other\nwords she dressed how she wanted to in a\ntime where that wasn't the norm to me\nwhat stands out the most is just that\npoint her style face and hair so\nperfectly complements her on an\noff-screen personality this homogeneity\nbetween the inside and outside that's so\ntrue to her features is still uncommon\neven to this day here's what I mean by\nthat when your personality is\nincongruent with the way you dress and\nto a lesser degree your face shape\npeople will call you out for it\ncase in point this guy on tick-tock was\nmaking a valid point about bathroom\nhygiene but all and I mean all of the\ncomments were picking on his looks it's\nnot even gay keeping at this point it\njust doesn't sue his face and while\nyou're free to dress however you like\nthere are certain things that harmonize\nwell with your face and there are\ncertain things that don't there are\ncertain things that make you more\nattractive and there are certain things\nthat don't anyway going back to Hepburn\nthe short hair works really well on it\nbecause she has almost perfect bone\nstructure and craniofacial development\nin fact she could wear any haircut and\npull it off because the face makes the\nhair and not the other way around\nfacial aesthetic wise Hepburn has a\nheart-shaped face much like the top\nmodels in the cutesy category\nlike Miranda Kerr QT isn't really a word\nso in David Gibbs book metamorphosis he\ndescribes his archetypal look as gammon\non Wikipedia it says large eyes moderate\nto thin lips and taut cheeks and flesh\nwhich is exactly what she has what I'm\ntrying to say is that she's not\nintimidating looking like Bella Hadid\none reason for that is that she has\nlarge rounded eyes which are seen as\nmore feminine I mean no one's going to\nbe intimidated by Bambi what a throwback\nher jaw is on the larger and more\ndefined side in terms of by Gonia width\nand mandible length this makes a quite\nandrogynous having a healthy mix between\nfeminine mid face features and a\nmasculine lower third unlike other\nmodels with a masculine jaw she has more\nandrogynous features because her face is\nquite swelled and slender Hepburn's\nfacial width to height ratio is lower\nthan someone like Miranda Kerr's it's\nwide but not too much a huge\nsimplification but research shows that\nthe wider someone's faces the more\ntrustworthy we perceive them to be\nwhich is why Audrey's wide but not too\nwide face makes her seem like the\nperfect trickster stereotype in the\nmovies harmless but mischievous\nZendaya's face is actually quite similar\nto her and it might help explain why she\nwas cast as Rou in euphoria when casting\ndirectors say you don't have the right\nlook they indirectly assessing your\npersonality through the medium of your\nface some say that physiognomy the\nscience of assigning personality through\nfacial features is pseudoscience but to\nme empirically it's the most human trait\nwe have it's how we assess friend or foe\nwhen meeting someone for the first time\nin a world before Photoshop and live CGI\nto me Audrey Hepburn was the pinnacle of\nbeauty for the era look at how well she\nhad aged even with the wrinkles and deep\nnasolabial folds her impeccable bone\nstructure still holds the skin taut\nthough Joel's Giles is a jowls\nno jowls or hollow cheeks and a perfect\nhairline I generally don't think there's\nanyone in the industry today that can\ncompare moving on we have Sean o Prai\nSean is today one of the highest if not\nthe highest-paid male model in the\nindustry which to me is a bit strange\nnormally we would think that the highest\npaid model would be objectively the\nbest-looking one but I disagree there\nSean to me has a very polarizing and\nmemorable face which is why I think he's\nthe highest paid models like lucky blue\nSmith have far better facial harmony but\nno feature quite stands out to make you\nthink twice other than oh that one\ngood-looking boy I saw the other day\nwith a Prai his iconic eye region is his\nbread and butter for staying relevant in\nthe industry long after everyone else\nhas died out in fact a better way to\ndifferentiate facial beauty from\nmodeling standards would be to see who\nhas stayed relevant the longest and that\nwould be none other than David Gandy in\nhis prime he was probably at the top for\nconventional masculinity through his\nfeatures but even now at 40 a time where\nmost men are fighting male pattern\nbaldness and beer bellies he is still\nbooking jobs tangent aside back to our\nPrai personally I think his eye area is\na bit excessive and detracts from his\nface but again that's what modeling\nwants memorable faces obviously he has a\nvery prominent brow Ridge and incredibly\nhooded eyes with a neutral can total and\nvery slight sclera show his lower eyelid\ndoes droop a little in every shot I've\nseen of him his jaw is again incredibly\nwell formed and slightly lower on the\nideal by Gonia width but defined and\nwide at the chin and mental region\nmaking it masculine\nnonetheless since his mid face is so\nsmall his jaw and subsequently lower\nthird takes up more than well\na third of the face it gives the\nappearance of his face being long and\nnarrow which is somewhat uh Nigel\ncompare that to Jordan Barrett who has\nan incredibly wide short face that suits\nhis similarly wide narrow eye areaa\npersonally I'm not a big fan of Shana\nPryor I just keep seeing cyclops from\nthe x-men cartoons last but not least\nAishwarya Rai Aishwarya is a prominent\nbollywood actress and model having won\nMiss India and Miss World among\ncountless other titles the most\nnoticeable thing about a her coloured\neyes dark features with coloured eyes is\nthe same reason David Gandy has a job\nit's unique and so it stands out and\nmeets modelling criteria here's another\nexample with former Maldivian model rota\natif who died in 2017 anthropometric Lee\nthere are a few differences with\nAishwarya her eye shape is both larger\nand wider than typically seen on\nCaucasian models it has slight scleral\nshow with a neutral capital and she has\nhigh cheekbones or pretty standard stuff\nwhat's different is that her face is\nless defined and has softer features\nthere's just less angularity all around\nfrom the cheekbones which are high but\nnot as prominent to her jaw mandible\nwhich is shorter in length because of\nher lower gurney or angle this is a\ncommon anthropometric feature seen\nthroughout the Indian subcontinent\nbut generally the jaw mandibles are\nshorter to compensate for a lower ramus\nand shallower angle otherwise she would\ndevelop an under by as a georgette sir\ntoo far forward compared her jaw to\nAudrey Hepburn's which is longer because\nit's angled downwards and still meets up\nat the nazy on for ideal craniofacial\ndevelopment all of these features makes\nher jaw characteristically more\nmasculine as it adds to her already\nsquarish face shape a better example is\nKareena Kapoor who has an over\nexaggerated jaw basically the same jaw\nas Aishwarya but wider with the lower\ncorner angle making it seem flatter it's\nreally hard to say much about Aishwarya\nbecause her features seem to change in\nevery photo and I'm gonna get angry\ncomments from fans saying that I'm wrong\nbecause I looked at\npicture while they're looking at another\nin this photo her jaw is angled\ndownwards and here it's an almost\n90-degree angle I personally really like\nthis screen grab from a YouTube video\nit's a bit blurry but it shows how well\nher features harmonize with their eyes\nboth in terms of color with the skin\ntone and in terms of shape with the\nfacial third proportion alright that\nbrings us to a close if you

"assistant", "content": "by now it's pretty self-evident that\nattractive people are simply treated\nbetter facial aesthetics has been found\nto correlate time and time again with\nwhat we know as the halo effect where we\nsubconsciously associate more positive\nqualities with people who are better\nlooking what does it mean to be better\nlooking though in the simplest form it\nmeans that your facial features are in\nharmony with each other and more\nimportantly their average now being\naverage has never exactly been\nconsidered a good thing I know if I\nbrought home AC report card I might as\nwell not but in terms of facial features\naverageness is good in positively\ninfluencing how people perceive you\nhaving an average plain-jane face might\nnot be attractive but having a few\naverage features like everyone else\nhelps you blend in for all the right\nreasons and stand out for others before\nwe can talk about the focus of this\nvideo how people see and treat you by\nyour jaw prognathism well first I need\nto explain what that actually is\nprognathism is the spatial relationship\nbetween your upper and lower jaw for\nthis experiment they've used the three\nrecognized skeletal classes from another\nstudy and we commonly know these as over\nbites and under bites there have been a\nfew studies a few of which I've linked\nin the description that have concluded\nclass one is more attractive than class\n2 with class 3 coming last although this\nis still heavily debated in the\ncommunity more interestingly\nattractiveness of facial features as\nrated by individuals with different\nlevels of education 2008 found obviously\nclass 1 again to be ideal as it's the\nmost average face and slightly protruded\nand recessed chins to be only marginally\nless attractive the most extreme cases\nof prognathism were deemed the least\nattractive similar trends were seen\nthrough multiple test groups each of\nvarying education levels with university\ngraduates scores being significantly\nlower than non graduates meaning that\nthe university graduates were more picky\nwhen selecting for facial attractiveness\nso I think it's fair to once again\nreaffirm that jaw averageness is good\nand is more or less universally\nin female participants in this case I'd\nassume it's likely the same for males\ntoo nothing really surprising there but\nit helps make our next and main research\npapers findings more rigorous as its\nbased on previously established fact\nfacial aesthetics and the assignment of\npersonality traits before and after\northogenetic surgery 2018 tries to\nscientifically quantify how much the\nhalo effect impacts improvements in\ncertain features in this case the jaw\nalignment the test raters consisted of\n83 females and 72 males age from 19 to\n42 and each were asked to evaluate test\nsubjects from the three prognathism\nclasses mentioned previously and an\nadditional latter of nei Thea class or\njaw asymmetry group general impressions\nupon seeing their face like perceptions\nof beauty successfulness faithfulness\netc were taken pre and post-op from the\nsubjects orthogenetic surgery except for\nclass one who are the control and have\nhad no surgery done the questionnaire\nwas divided into physical aesthetic\nimpressions and personality impressions\nwith the following results class three\ndraws heavily protruded ones benefited\nthe most from the surgery having the\ngreatest change in pre and post-op\nperceptions especially in beauty\npleasantness attractiveness and health\nin fact they rated higher than any other\nclass in all aspects of the\nquestionnaire post-op including the\naverage control group class one perhaps\nor hiding an inner beauty that the\nprotruded jaw heavily detracted from or\nmaybe surgeons are better at correcting\nthis type of deformity than with other\nclasses\nthe other two classes class two and\nlateral Athiya also benefited from\ncorrective surgery but the mean\ndifferences were less pronounced and as\nvisually seen the graph gradients are\nshallower lastly the class one control\ngroup normally aligned jaws went down in\nall aspects from their initial ratings\nagain out guesser once everyone had\ntheir corrective surgery the playing\nfield was even and the control group\nwere rated more accurately against\nhigher beauty standards now in the\npersonality section things are less\nclear-cut faithfulness good-natured and\ngentle are qualifiers that showed little\ndeviation pre and post-op which supports\nother research papers that suggests we\ndetermine those things more from the eye\nregion and mid face rather than the\nlower third and jaw they didn't change\ntheir eye shapes and so there's no\nreason for them to have more aggressive\nlooking faces and vice versa\ninterestingly all classes except the\ncontrol were deemed to be more confident\nafter increasing in attractiveness\nhere's where things got grey because\nalthough we started this video talking\nabout the halo effect and its\ncorrelation to facial attractiveness\nonly one of the five personality\nparameters actually showed any\ncorrelation while I don't deny that the\neffect exists this study only really\nlooks at the jaw and so to draw\nconclusions like improving just my jaw\nwill make me better perceived in every\naspect of my life like the halo suggests\nis a bit short-sighted\nhowever improving jaw alignment does\nimprove sexual dimorphism in both men\nand women which i think is what these\nparticipants are actually rating as\nconfidence you can't see physical\nconfidence from a face that's just\nridiculous but you can see factors that\nindicate higher testosterone and\nindicate genetic health in a face which\nthe average person may attribute as\nlooking confident just google confident\nguy and tell me what they all look like\nfixing your jaw has many benefits in how\nyou're perceived but the majority of\nmodern humans have some level of\nmalocclusion or jaw misalignment in\ntheir faces so how do you know when it's\nworth fixing and when it's worth leaving\nthe final study that we're going to look\nat today the influence of mandibular\nprominence on facial attractiveness 2005\ntries to answer just that with degrees\nof deviance the study opens with a paper\nby Alpena\nAttell that found that patients have a\npreferred expectation of what they want\nto look like after surgery and while the\nsurgeon and patients both share similar\nviews the surgeon was more lenient to a\nfew degrees of deviation from the\npatient's idealized view in other words\nthe patient's had a lower tolerance and\nexpected perfection from their surgeons\nwhen in reality that's just not possible\nwhen degrees matter as you'll find out\npatients can be left least satisfied\nwith the final product which is why\nanswering the question of when should I\nget a job is so important because it's\nreally weighing pros against cons fixing\nsomething that's not broken and ending\nup with the worst result the method used\nhere is very similar to others in this\nfield of study produce a few images and\nbury them by a variable and then show\nthem to participants to rate the test\nvaried images by the cell and AG on to\npoint B angle which is the s and B and\nit's a way of measuring as a function of\njaw position in relation to the upper\nmaxilla and mid face so it's a form of\ncephalo metric analysis as expected the\nmore the angle deviates away from the\nnorm the less attractive the face\nbecomes the results follow a bell curve\nand the most attractive angle was\nactually the control angle the Eastman\nnormal value of 78 degrees this value is\ntaken from an average of test subjects\nin 1987 with almost perfectly aligned\njaws the study highlights that improving\nmore extreme cases of skeletal\ndiscrepancy brings about the most gains\naesthetically attractiveness dropped the\nmost when going from 73 to 70 point 5\ndegrees for class 2 and 83 to 85 point 5\nin class 3 if you are greater than these\nouter bounds then it may be worth\nconsidering correction two-thirds of\nparticipants would not seek treatment\nfor profiles with the s and B of 73 to\n83 degrees and\nis backed up by the data as well as\nwithin these ranges the aesthetic\nimprovements are only minor this range\nis actually different to what also\nDantas typically consider acceptable\nfrom 75 to 81 degrees to some this video\nof there's a larger range of what we\nconsider acceptable features while the\nbalance for what's acceptable is larger\nthan what orthodontists consider\nacceptable the most attractive is still\nthe most average value which is why I\nkeep harping on average nurse being\nattractive in faces as in scientifically\nquantified averageness like the Eastman\nvalue of 78 if your jaw is beyond the 73\nto 83 degree SNB then it may be worth\nconsulting you're also dontist\nabout it because

{"role": "assistant", "content": "welcome back to Instagram versus reality\nepisode 10 if you're just joining us\nthis is the segment on the channel where\nwe go over your favorite Instagram is\nand how they edit their photos to\nconvince you that they actually look\nlike that in reality as always a quick\ndisclaimer that I'm not trying to target\nor harm anyone's brand the video is\nsimply meant to be informative using\nreadily available information on the web\nthis week the majority of the photos and\nvideos are from Instagram reality the\nsubreddit with a few from tik-tok in\nYouTube now I get that you clicked on\nthis video for a 200-page\nKardashian expose but before that let's\nget through some of these easy examples\nto warm you up so with this first one\nthere's not a whole lot to talk about\nbut it's a case of skin smoothening with\na slight selective blur to remove the\ncellulites\nmicro wrinkles chances are if they\nphotoshop one aspect of their body\nthey'll continue to do so for the others\nso if you look over and at her belly\nshe's sucked out in use from the liquify\ntool what's great about editing a photo\nlike this is that the camera puts her\ninto focus so that the background\nbecomes blurry which makes for an easy\nliquify job without distorting any fine\ndetails pretty relatively cut and dry so\nwe'll just move on the infamous case of\nsausage fingers I say this all the time\nwith edits on Instagram you cannot and I\nmean can not remove natural body creases\nwhen editing a photo wrinkles are fine\nto remove because they have no real\nbodily function but creases in the skin\nare needed for muscles and skin to move\nfreely I get asked a lot to edit fingers\nand underarms but generally leaving\nthese aspects in makes your photo more\nrealistic and lets you get away with\nother edits without being blatantly\nobvious alright I guess it's time for\nthe Kardashians so we start off with\nKylie at this point she's a regular on\nthe channel and it's clear to see why\nshe's channeling her inner Katara to\nbusiness and the efficient in the\nbackground in fact in all of her photos\nsomething's bending so she's either an\nx-men a waterbender or a very poor\nPhotoshop artist\nit's a shame so many people guys and\ngirls alike think that Kylie's body is\nnatural\neven with clear proof every single week\nI still get the same comment this was\ntaken on the same damn day you can see\nthe constant fear of having someone take\na photo that you have no control over\nand this is Kylie Jenner's makeup artist\nI see nothing wrong here everything's\nfine no work done whatsoever no\nPhotoshop they're bending walls they're\njust natural just comes with the job oh\nyes this is some of Kylie's earlier\nmasterpieces her eyes are uncanny and\nout of proportion to her face\nthey've been enlarged and using the spin\ntool in liquify and you can see a clear\nblue zone on her lower eyelid not to\nmention the lower eyelid makes a sudden\ndrop-off here whereas the other is a\nmore natural curvilinear line on the\nright what's there to say obvious blurs\nlands near her waist her left thigh\nlooks like someone took a bite out of it\nthe right butt is bending the floor\npanels to her will this edit is nothing\nlike the work she does now and it shows\nto me that at this time she was really\njust like any other teenage girl knowing\nenough about further manipulation to\nbegin but not enough to pull it off\nconvincingly I mean I have to give it to\nher\nwhoever her plastic surgeon is is\nprobably the best that money can buy the\nphoto editor probably not as much the\nstraight lines of the fabric backing\nwall are contouring towards her neck\nit's a pretty clear liquify job she's\nnot editing the neck however she's\nlowering her trapezoid muscles which\nnaturally flex up when pulling that pose\nas I'll cover in a future defining\nbeauty episode subscribe catch that\nlower trapezoids gives the impression of\na more feminine slimmer neck which\naccentuates her high cheekbones\nconversely on guys a thicker wider neck\ngives a more masculine look and greatly\nimproves facial time orphism\nit's like a plus 2 points on guys if\nit's done correctly so as Jeff Nippon\noften says never skip leg day\nI mean I did say this was a Kardashian\nspecial not a Kylie special it wouldn't\nbe fair to Kylie anyway because I\ndisliked them all equally\nwell maybe not Scott Disick but he\ndoesn't count anyway with photos like\nthis there isn't a whole lot I can point\nout in terms of editing or how it is\nedited because there's heavy\npost-processing involved that distorts\nthe tell-tale signs of liquify use or\neven skin retouching\nhowever the four faces are all\nsupposedly different and those\nsupposedly meant to be khloe kardashian\nat the same time you can just tell by\nlooking at it in the defining beauty\nseries I covered the terminology that\ntells you exactly how the different like\nfor instance the gonio angle of the jaw\nin number 2 is far shallower than\nChloe's reel angle in number 3 whose eye\nGrammatik facial width in number 3 is\nfar wider than that of number 4 making\nher seem to have a longer face her\nbegonia with in number 1 makes it look\nlike a bootleg kylie jenner but in\nnumber 4 it's a lot narrower\nit may seem pedantic to point out these\nspecific features but in aspects of\nplastic surgery portrait are and\nPhotoshop retouching these are important\nfeatures to consider to recreate the\nsame face and stop this from happening\nthe differences in facial parameters are\ntoo large to be justified by angles and\nparallax error check out the defining\nBeauty series if you haven't already to\nlearn more about how we define faces I\nsay this often but the way most\ninfluences get caught out is by video\nit's harder to edit but not impossible\nI've covered how faces are edited in\nHollywood productions and soon I'll be\nreleasing part 2 that covers how it's\ndone on live streams like twitch and\nInstagram is Kylie getting caught out in\nthe same way Instagram versus Instagram\nlive editing wise there isn't much to\nsay I'll give her the benefit of the\ndoubt and say it's like this because\nshe's mid-sentence but it's a good\nexample to use to point out the side\neffects of filler injections the trend\ngoes that guys often get permanent\nimplants to mimic bone structure and\ngirls get fillers to mimic facial fat\nsofter faces are seen as more attractive\non women and more defined almost gornt\nfaces are seen better on men\nin that regard men have a very clear\nadvantage because villas have a\nlong-term side effect of shifting around\nthe face as you age by unnaturally\nadding more soft mass to your face in\nthe form of hyaluronic villas you're\nsimulating the job of fat naturally in\nyour face problem is that moves and the\nmore you have of it the deeper the\ncreases on your face get as a gradient\nfrom regions of filler to those with no\nfiller become more pronounced it'll look\ngreat while you're still and not moving\nbut adding extra mass changes your\nfacial biomechanics deepening natural\ncreases like the nasolabial line to move\nmuscles around as you speak again with\nkhloé' same deal as before her allo\nwidth so this part of the nose is\nsmaller her eye colours are completely\ndifferent from green to brown and I\ndoubt sunlight can do that since half\nher face is covered by hair on the right\nthere isn't much else I can comment on\nthis picture actually came from a family\nphoto on Twitter so it's not like I'm\ncherry-picking the photos either and\nthis next one is actually from the same\nday as the previous one I can't really\ntell what's bending in the background it\ncould be a pillow on a chair but Kylie's\nsitting on the chairs armrest so that\npillow would have to be floating in the\nair also it's a coincidence that it's\nbending upwards near Kim's waist so my\nverdict is that it's a liquify edit for\npeople who make a living of their\nappearance you'd think that they'd spend\nmore time inspecting the background to\nleave no room for doubt that their\nphotos are edited now here's something\ninteresting ever notice how the\nKardashians other Instagram influences\nand modeling photoshoots almost never\nsmile in their photos smiling distorts\nyour features on camera and makes you\nless photogenic so it's always been\nstrange to me that the default go-to\nresponse is to smile for a photo the\nKardashians always go with the\nblue-steel pose which adds to their aura\nof exclusivity and staying aloof from\neveryday people but then you see this\nand it ruins appeal my point being the\nway you pose your face is just as\nimportant as the composite\nof the photo itself and can change the\nentire tone of it do it enough times\nover an Instagram career and people will\nstart to associate those feelings of\nexclusivity with you but obviously\nthere's a charm to it that the\nKardashians have mastered trying without\nlooking like they're trying which is why\nyou will love it when they get caught\nediting their photos it breaks the\nillusion it's why people love Keeping Up\nwith the Kardashians they're selling but\nthe poison and the cure they're selling\nbut the exclusivity and the inclusivity\nby bringing you into their lives out of\nthese girls if there's anyone you should\nlook up to it's probably Kris Jenner\nshe's an absolute marketing genius all\nright that brings another episode of\nInstagram versus reality Kardashian\nspecial to a close before you click away\nsome important announcements me and a\nteam of developers vector illustrators\nand photo retouches I had to pull a lot\nof phases working on building cubes calm\nhere there'll be articles of scripts\nthat have written but can't fit into any\nof my episodes more in-depth breakdowns\nof photo editing and more defining\nBeauty content I'll have a lot of the\nsensitive articles be verified by their\nrespective professionals to give you the\nmost accurate content coos comm is\ngeared more towards the facial aspect\nside of beauty like the defining Beauty\nseries because there aren't a whole lot\nof blogs that cover that concisely on\nthe internet articles discussing the\nfactors that influence jaw shape\ndifferent beauty standards etc all of\nthe things I can't fit into a video\nwithout going off on a tangent a lot of\nyou have been asking me to rate your\nfaces by a lot I mean like 400 plus\nrequests a week another set of you have\nbeen asking to hire me as a photo\nretoucher both of which are services I'd\nlike to mainstream on the site to get\nthrough with more clients because I have\nmy hands full right now if you like the\nquality of these videos you can expect\njust as much effort in the quality of\nthe site and the content I give you\n[Music]"}]}

B)\nThe light hitting her butt does downwards\nand not obliquely like the rest of her body,\nand is for the most part dissipated because\nthe pixels that were showing the light were\nmashed together in the liquify tool soup.\nIf anything there should be more light on\nher butt because it's closer to the light\nsource.\nI expected better of emrata.\nI get comments on my previous videos like\ndude, you don’t need to focus on the technicalities\nand these minute details, you can clearly\ntell its edited.\nI’m sorry for the voice, I just naturally\nassumed they’re low iq.\nThe reason why I go into the finer details\nis to provide evidence of editing.\nI can clearly see that it's edited, but If\ni said oh here you go it's edited, how?\nI don’t know, I’d be no better than the\nthousands of other sensationalist drama channels.\nIf it's not an easy case of bending walls\nyou might be able to tell me how it's edited\nbut you wouldn’t be able to tell me why\nit's edited without these finer details.\nSometimes people just post such blatantly\nbad edits I can’t help but think the jokes\non me.\nI mean, the gap between the panels tells you\nexactly what she’d moved around in the liquify\ntool.\nA cinch at the waist here and a little adobe\ngains there and the photoshop fairy is all\ndone.\nOh this is a good one that I’ve been meaning\nto show you all for weeks.\nIn instagram reality ep.1 there were comments,\nnot a lot but few that absolutely refused\nto believe kylie edited her photos and it\nwas all bad angles, a long day at work making\nbillions and bad lighting.\nIn this photo the door frame appears to be\nbending inwards, which is called me crazy,\nis an indicator of liquify tool use.\nIt's also a good example of illustrating what\nI mean by image artifacts and blur zones,\nbecause to me that's the best evidence of\nliquify edits there is and the majority of\ninstagram uses this type of edit more than\nany other.\nHere's a not so quick recap, when you use\nthe liquify photoshop, or whatever app you're\nusing, it converts all the pixels to a pixel\ndistortion map of X,y coordinates, when you\nmove a pixel it remaps it to a new coordinate,\nbut the existing pixel that was already there\ndoesn’t get deleted, it either gets blurred\nor the two pixels get combined resulting in\nimage artifacts.\nIf it got deleted you’d end up with black\ndots all over your image.\nThere's an in depth article on how the algorithm\nworks in javascript in the description if\nyou’re really interested.\nIn kylies edit, there's an aura of overlapped\npixels that forms around the doorframe because\nmodern cameras pick up all shades of a shadow,\nmeaning when they overlap you get a distinct\nglow around the edited parts as pixels are\ncombined.\nI don’t even know why she did it, it was\nsuch high risk for such little reward.\nStrange how there's always distorted lines\naround their hips.\nMaybe it's an artistic effect because these\nlines are as straight as James Charles.\nI can't see a reason for editing the tiles\nhere because it wouldn’t affect her body\nshape but this line here definitely indicates\nthat her hips were widened.\nShe has red pupils, at this point I think\nshe knew she messed up and called it art.\nYou know what annoys me.\nWhen people edit their photos and then put\na motivational quote acting like its au naturale.\nHer left elbow is 2 times as thick as her\nright.\nShe’s pulled her waist in from both sides,\nthe problem is her arm got in the way so the\nliquify tool dragged those pixels with it.\nDoes this shape look natural to you?\nStraight, sin wave, and they say maths isn’t\nuseful.\nHere's one for the boys, where he’s pulled\nhis jaw outwards causing the pole on the fence\nto bend.\nNow this one throws in a bit of doubt, like\n12 angry men.\nThe singular pole is bent’ but the others\nare straight meaning it was done with quite\na fine brush to not disrupt anything else.\nThere are two different types of inflections\non the pole, one one and one here, indicating\ntwo separate edits.\nThis inflection here suggests that he raised\nthe skin underneath his jaw, there's also\na bit of a pixel spill over creating an blend\nin pixels from where his jaw ends and the\nbackground begins.\nHis hyoid bone has been raised because this\nshrub in the background curves in the same\ndirection as his lower hyoid bone.\nLast bit of evidence to present to the jury\nis the blurring of light here.\nIf you notice very carefully, as soon as I\ntouch the pole with the liquify tool it instantly\nstarts to blur and its most noticeable on\nthe bright white reflection which turns into\nan offwhite colour.\nThese poles are straight and unedited but\nthe wavy pole has this offwhite, blurred effect\nin the original image, meaning it was tampered\nwith.\nImpossibly perfect jawlines are a lot rarer\nthan you think.\nAlright, that brings another episode to a\nclose.\nAs always leave a like because it supports\nthe channel.\nI’ll be putting out defining beauty ep.3\nsoon where I cover the how the nose influences\nyour face shape and week after it should be\nthe jaw.\nBe sure to click the little notification bell,\nor so youtube keeps telling me to tell you\nthat and follow me @shvfee if you like chill,\naesthetic vibes."}]}

I notice\nthat on the right more of his eyes are\nexposed they essentially look larger\nbecause his brow bone has been raised in\nthe Edit it completely changes the look\nand makes him seem more bug-eyed rather\nthan deep-set and mysterious because\nanatomically they'd have to be pushed\nfurther out due to less orbital bone\nsupport in anatomy the orbital bones are\nthe socket burns in case your eye\nsmaller orbital sockets like Tom's\nactual face produce wider more\nDesirables shapes than larger orbital\nsockets which again are influenced by\nskull type more prominent\nlike features like brow bones I know Tom\nisn't a Neanderthal but they indicate\nhigher testosterone in the womb and have\nbeen linked to more dominant a certain\npersonalities upon maturation the size\nof your eye area also influences your\nfacial harmony if you have a long face\nthan your eyes as in the entire\nstructure and not just the eyeball need\nto be physically larger ideally both\nvertically and horizontally to stay in\nproportion this example covers the same\npoints as Tom's except for two details\nhis image didn't have notice how the\nupper eyelid covers more of the eyeball\non the left image than the one on the\nright which exposes entire eye upper\neyelid exposure is a feature form from\neither fat stored above the eye or from\na prominent brow Ridge as more of the\nbrow spills over the eyes the amount of\neyelid exposed reduces upper eyelid\nexposure is undesirable because it makes\nyou seem tired and gives the impression\nof more protruding eyes\naka bug eyes I'll it exposed however\nchanges throughout the day for most\npeople take a picture of yourself right\nafter waking up and compare with one\ntaking during the midday the image on\nthe Left also has a negative cantle tilt\nwhich as I explained in episode 1 of the\nseries makes your face seem saggy and\ntired the image on the right has a\npositive cam photo which is in harmony\nwith his face as all of his features\nangled downwards and towards a b taper\nnow that I've covered all of these\nfeatures that make up the eye region I\nwant to emphasize that not all of these\ncan be split into good and bad desirable\nand undesirable between men and women\ncertain features are considered\nmasculine and feminine and favor one\ngender over the other this is called\nsexual dimorphism for instance more\nrounded eyes indicate youthfulness and a\nmore desirable on women than men as such\nlarger eyes have created a scale arrow\nshow in this drawing the subject has\nround eyes with Calero show but still\nlooks conventionally pretty but the\nexact same features on a guy and it just\ndoesn't work I just really don't like\nAziz Ansari and everything is fanciful\non the other hand louis Tomlinson has\nsimilar eye features as Tom Cruise and\nis considered attractive by\nsixteen-year-old teenage girls\neverywhere likewise Sendhil Ramamurthy a\nsound Indian American actor has the same\nmasculine features of wider deep set\neyes and a prominent brow bone leading\nhim to being the poster child of\nattractive South Indian guys\nevery where he also has dark eyes which\nare in harmony with his complexion and\nso I disagree that having colored eyes\nare a desirable feature or at least\nplace their importance very low to\nfinish up scientists aren't conducting\nthese studies to make men and women feel\nbad about not having the desirable\nfeatures to be considered attractive so\nfar we know that identifying facial\nbeauty and harmony occupies six points\nof our temporal lobe that's precious\nreal estate if you're swiping on tinder\nresearch suggests that it takes you less\nthan three seconds to decide if the\nperson is attractive or not a separate\nmeta analysis of our most recent studies\nby Syracuse University puts a number at\n1/5 of a second to fall in love our\nbrain knows all of these things\nsubconsciously because it's in our\nbiological imperative to choose the best\nlooking partner this series is all about\nputting what we already know in two\nwords aka defining beauty\n[Music]"}]}

the all of his shoulder joint\nthat's definitely disproportionate is\nyou would have Michael felt like\nproportions and except he probably\ndoesn't have the Michael Phelps like\nheight to justify that kind of shoulder\nto shoulder to clavicle ratio also if\nyou pay close attention you see that his\nleft side is considerably longer than\nhis right side which is why it looks so\nodd in the first place it's just I'd say\nit's a really bad Photoshop job and it's\nso bad that it's it leaves you confused\nit's just what if this guy actually does\nlook like that so my verdict on this\nphoto is that he's either a freak of\nnature and he's a swimming athlete or\nthis is a very bad Photoshop job it's\none of those three and I would give this\na 3 out of 5 in terms of\nMagnus alrighty this next photo it's\njust way too easy these wavy line\npictures they just how do you feel how\ndo people not notice that do you not\nlook at your own photo after you've\nfinished editing yet it's and why would\nyou okay so me personally if I'm ever\nrecommending photoshopping an image and\nsometimes we do have to photoshop images\nfor clients generally I would never ever\ntell them to stand in front of anything\nstraight just for this exact reason it's\nso so easy to detect and trying to fix\nthis issue is in super high it takes a\nlot of time you basically have to cut\nout that section from the original image\nand then like stitch it on to the the\nedited image just to avoid that bending\nof the lines but this is so\nstraightforward the lines of Bend it's\nan obvious liquify tool like I said\nbefore when you use the liquify tool you\nmove adjacent pixels with the waist in\nthis case so when you're shortening your\nwaist you're also shorten Engle lines\nwhich causes them to not be straight and\nparallel so this next one is from view\ndefaults I think most of you know about\nbeautiful it's an Instagram page that\nshowcases basically what we're doing\nhere and the my only criticism is of\nBeautiful's is that sometimes they do\nmisrepresent images sometimes when\nimages aren't even edited like the one\nI'm going to tell you about now they do\ntry to just pick up the worst photo and\nthe best photo of someone and try to\nbasically shame them into suggesting\nsomething or like just being implicit\nand not being too straightforward and\nhonest about how they're going about\ngetting these photos and for that reason\nI am a bit critical of beauty faults but\nnonetheless this is a good example to\ntalk about in terms of the liquify tool\nbeing used here I really wouldn't\ncriticize her too much for any of this\nbecause if you look at her waist even in\nthe worst photo that beautiful to could\nfind her it's already pretty symmetrical\nand well shaped and even and in the\nedited photo or the supposedly edited\nphoto it's also it bears a similar\nproportion and shape to the non edited\none and for that reason I really can't\nAltaf or I can't detect anything myself\nif you look at the share of the green\nwater in the right image with the share\nof the sky in the left image it tells me\nthat there's a lot of color grading\ngoing on especially her tan skin is a\nbig giveaway if you look at the two\nimages another thing is that the water\nshould reflect the shade of the sky\nbecause that's just how water reflects\nlight and them not being set the same\ntells me that she did edit peak colors\nin a post processing software however to\nher credit that's not much of a sin\nbecause almost all of our photos have to\nbe color graded just because of how\ncameras pick up light they're not as\ngood as our eyes and it's just not fair\nto the photographer if you can't pick up\nwhat our eyes can see\none more thing is that from the left\nimage it might look like she edited her\nthigh gap I'm not really sure what the\ndeal is with that but I would not say\nthat she actually did even if it might\nlook like it did because of how\ndifficult it is to edit straight lines\nwhen you do use the liquify tool like I\nmentioned before now it does create\njagged lights and in this case there are\nno jagged lines especially on the\nstriped beach towel that she's sitting\non overall I would give her a 1 out of 5\nI think she's done a pretty legitimate\njob in the photo so again we're using\nanother beautiful image even though I\ndon't really like them\nand it's to highlight the power of skin\nretouching so if you look at the two\nimages I wouldn't say that there's a\nwhole lot of liquify tool going on maybe\njust around the cheeks of the lower\ncheekbone and the jawline might just be\nsmoothed up a bit but then again that's\njust an angle thing I mean you can just\nas easily achieve that with an angle and\na blue still look now to be completely\nfair with her her skin tone complexion\nand porosity matched the edited photo\nvery very closely I wouldn't even say\nthat she's skinned retouched at our\nwhole lot I don't know maybe - the\npictures very low-quality\non the unedited version and for that\nreason I can't really make out the\ndetails but\nthe edited version just has a bit more\ncontrast and a better lighting situation\non the right she looks like she's in\ntheir car so obviously it's a lot darker\nbut the edited photo has a slight color\ngradient where she adjusts her Soloff\nskintone to have a bit more of a tan now\nI was gonna give her a 1 out of 5 in\nterms of how its edited which is the\nlower score is better obviously but if\nyou look at a filter and that's the part\ndirectly under the tip of the nose\nyou'll notice that it's a more upturned\non the image on the left than the one on\nthe right and this is part of being\nmaking your nose less aquiline and we're\nan aquiline nose is considered Beach\nshaped or eagle shaped and people\ngenerally don't prefer that in the\nWestern Beauty standard which is why\nit's often changed and edited especially\nthe dorsal hump which is the bridge of\nyour nose so I just had to get a second\nopinion from some of my med school\nfriends that part in particular is\ncalled the info trip break and when you\nmove that that also moves the tip of the\nnose up and as you can see from the two\nimages it's pretty obvious I just wanted\nyou to be able to put it into words as\nto why it looks different oh no it's\nanother one of these okay so as you can\nsee the lamppost is bending because her\nbooty so big that it warps gravity and\ntime and for that reason we can see that\nher waist has also been moved inwards\nlike I said before if you guys really\nwant to do this kind of editing do not\nstand in front of anything complex all\nright the simple is stand in front of a\nwhite background and you can do anything\nto the photo like you can Photoshop\nyourself in a plane like this guy did\nhere also curves has a service where we\ncan do the editing for you but that's\nnot open just yet because we're focused\non teaching the content first before we\ntake in submissions this picture is also\nvery oversaturated I can tell because\nher dress which I'm guessing was\nprobably like some kind of orange has\nnow turned fluorescent and it just hurts\nto look at and if you look at this guy\nand the white snow it's off-white so\nthere's definitely been a filter applied\nI would say a filter rather than a\nlookup table because a lookup table is\nselectively where the filter is what\neverything and in this case the white\nsnow has turned off light right all\nright all right so that was the last\npicture of today I really enjoy making\nthese videos because it just lets me\ntalk about all these concepts that you\nlearn about in like the art school and\nother places and you don't really get to\ntalk about in a accessible way I don't\nreally get to teach it to very many\npeople because it's not something you\nreally think about until it's pointed\nout to you so that's the goal of this\nseries I'm trying to point things out\nthat you don't really think about and\nI'm training your eye to pick these\nthings out as you learn about it\nyourself"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Video Title: Learn How They Edited Their Photos | Instagram Vs Reality Ep. 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "hey what is up guys today we're doing\nsomething a little bit different called\nInstagram versus reality which is a new\nsegment on the channel that I'll be\nintroducing and we're just gonna be\nlooking at different photos on Instagram\nand I'm gonna be exposing or we're gonna\njust be learning together how they are\nedited into what you see and what you\nactually get in reality now I'd like to\nput out the disclaimer that I'm not\nactually targeting anyone and I'm not\ntrying to injure their brand but I do\nwant to point out that there are there\nare a lot of differences between what\nyou see on Instagram and I think most of\nus should be aware at least to some\ndegree how they're done and how you\nshouldn't actually believe everything\nyou see on Instagram so right off the\nbat there isn't any further manipulation\nI'd like to point out per say she's not\ntrying to use the transform tool to make\nherself look better in any way but she\nthe Instagram in this case has actually\nused a lookup table which is what\nincreases the vibrancy of the colors if\nyou compare the left and the right the\ngreens are darker sharper the oranges\nare far more dominant the more salient\nand for that reason the picture just\nlooks better but the main point of this\nphoto is just to point out Instagram is\nare jerks to her credit though I am very\nvery jealous as she got that shot and\nthey've actually had to close the park\ndown because so many Instagram has tried\nrecreating that and they've just made\nthat huge mess that you can see on the\nright so I guess that's why they call\nthem an influencer so this is actually a\nreally good example in illustrating when\nyou've gone too far\nin Photoshop so the way you get this\neffect is through the liquify tool and\nfor those of you that don't know the\nliquify tool is a destructive tool\nmeaning it saves on top of itself as you\nwork along and you oftentimes lose sight\nof the original picture and you get\ncarried away it's very easy to get\ncarried away\nso to me the biggest giveaway is\nobviously the hips do look a bit\nunnatural they're way too linear\nthere's in the human body there is no\nsuch thing as a straight line and for\nthat reason I would be a bit suspicious\nI would also investigate by looking\nfurther into the clouds because when you\ndo use the liquify tool it's like you\nit's like a big porridge and you're\ndisturbing the porridge around and as\nyou move pixels around you move the\npixels adjacent to it as well and for\nthat reason you do get a lot of Caring\nin the background which is why you get\nthose like wavy lines and everything\nthat's a big giveaway and not to mention\nthat the hips are way too symmetrical\ngenerally humans don't have that kind of\nsymmetry so if you do want to edit like\nthis and I understand why you might want\nto there is a proper way of going about\nit where the in the liquify tool there's\na slight there's a little slider and\nessentially if you bring it back down at\n80%\nit undoes 20% of your last edit in if if\nyou think of it that way and basically\nit just brings you back to the realm of\nnormalcy so you want to keep your\nchanges slight this is way too dramatic\nand that's why it's so obvious to see\n[Music]\ndid anybody for a second actually think\nthat she looks like the left picture in\nreal life so right off the bat I can\ntell that the hair has definitely been\nreworked there's no flyaways no strands\nno loose edges it's completely straight\nlike y equals MX plus B straight also\npay attention to the knows where the\ndorsal hump has been reduced a bit to\nmake it more aquiline which is a fancy\nway of saying make it more smaller and\ncurvier and then from then on we can\njust see that the whole skin has been\nretouched nobody glows like that in real\nlife and with that we can also tell that\nthe eyebrows the eyes have also been\nedited\nnotice the eye colour it's definitely\nwhen you take a photo your eye color\ndoes not pop like that it's always\nalmost always edited in post-processing\nand I say this because if you look at\nour eye look at the light reflecting off\nit the part nearest to the titter\ngenerally\ndoesn't reflect light like that it's way\ntoo vibrant and lastly do I even need to\ntalk about the lips I mean come on\nliquify tool also one thing I just did\nnotice is that her jaw especially her\nchin is a lot more protruded in the left\nimage than the right that could just be\nthe angle but I would I wouldn't be\nsurprised if you also use the liquify\ntool there because that is one of the\ncommon uses of the liquify tool I really\nlike this image because it's just so\nrandom to me it's like who are you\nposing to why are you posing like that\nwhere are the coconuts coming from\nanyway I wouldn't say that either of\nthese motors are edited in any way\nreally other than a light color gradient\nwhich may or may not even then that's a\nbit that's a bit of a stretch because\nthese pictures are quite plain in terms\nof color and vibrancy but it is a simple\ncase of just sucking in your tummy guys\nto where girls do it I don't have body\nshame anyone but is just what it is so\nhere's a photo that kind of speaks for\nitself this the context behind this is\nan Instagram star turn to YouTube and\nstarted making videos there and\neventually the real I guess I suppose\nhow she actually looks came out in terms\nof editing I wouldn't really say that\nthe bottom picture is edited if you look\nat the snow it's a bit of white which is\nkind of how cameras pick up snow the top\nphoto might have been edited in terms of\ncolor to be hard to tell it's definitely\nbeen edited in terms of composition and\nfacial structure using a liquify tool\nand you can tell just by looking at the\nlower third region of both both the\npictures and there has been a bit of a\nchange in the buccal region of her face\nso I really hope that you enjoyed\ncovering these things with me today we\nwent over some of these simple aspects\nof the liquify tool and in the future\nI'll be releasing guides on how to\nproperly use these tools so that we\ndon't make the same mistake that these\nguys are made here if you've enjoyed\nthis type of video and you want to see\nmore episodes 2 2 3 & 4 then leave

"content": "a lot of people don't actually\nunderstand the reason why they don't see\nany sort of results when looksmaxing\nalthough they started looksmaxing there\nare habits that still prevent them from\nachieving their goals and progressing at\na good rate first habit on our list is\nnot being consistent with the goals you\nset I know a few guys from Discord who\nare constantly switching up their goals\nand end up wasting their time in the\nlong term because they never do the\nthings that are necessary for a\nsufficient enough time the prime example\nof this is in the gym when people are\nconstantly switching from bulking to\ncutting when they start to lose a bit of\ntheir definition they panic and decide\nto cut and when they are in a cutting\nphase and they start to feel small they\npanic and start to bulk again what this\ndoes is you never build enough size on\nyour bulks and you never cut enough body\nfat on your Cuts how do you fix this\nlimit your daily exposure to the\ninternet and stick to your goal and do\nit for a sufficient amount of time the\nsecond habit is not being approachable\nand looking angry all the time with the\nrise of the look maxing movement I've\nnoticed that some men are walking\nlooking around with an angry look on\ntheir face they also portray this to\ntheir pictures and it almost seems like\nthey are doing this to look more\nattractive but it always backfires\nbecause when certain facial expressions\nare forced it almost never looks good\nyou guys have probably heard of forced\nversus natural smiles and similar\nconcept can apply this yeah I am\nbasically calling out all the dudes out\nthere who are squinting frowning and\nsucking in their cheeks in hopes of\nlooking more attractive because they\nthink that by doing that they will have\nHunter eyes or Hollow cheeks two things\nthat got very popular with the rise of\nthe looksmaxing movement you don't need\nto smile all the time to look\napproachable and it is certainly\npossible to overdo smiling but generally\nspeaking it is better to smile than to\nfrown speaking of pictures if you guys\nare looking for a in-depth guide on how\nto maximize online dating comment down\nbelow I see far far too many guys who\nhave no idea how to present themselves\non online dating the third habit that is\nmaking you uglier is not having a\nskincare routine you know how most women\nhave a great quantity of products that\nthey apply each day luckily for us men\nthat is not necessary tii Hanley a\nrenowned skincare brand with thousands\nof five-star reviews from all around the\nworld makes skin care for men simple and\nuncomplicated they provide with all the\nproducts that you need and none that you\ndon't they also provide a clear\ninstruction card that tells you how to\nuse the products how much to use and\nwhen I suggest you start with the level\none system which includes all the basics\na daily face wash a exfoliator scrub a\nmorning moisturizer with SPF and an\nevening moist izer there are also two\nacne systems for those that are\ncurrently dealing with acne the first\nthing a woman notices on a man is his\nface and skin is at the top of the\nhierarchy if you have pimples wrinkles\nunder eye circles and other issues with\nthe skin women are going to see you as\nless attractive even if you are\nconventional attractive from a feature\nand bone structure perspective teacha\nHandley products are fragrance-free and\ntheir products are designed to be very\nlightweight this is good because this\nway they won't clog your pores and\nbecause they are fragrance-free\nthey are suitable for sensitive skin\ntypes and because TIY Hanley is\nsponsoring today's video they are\noffering you a great deal click the\nfirst link in the description and you'll\nget 30% off your first box plus a free\ngift the fourth habit that is making you\nuglier is excessive gaming think about\nit you spend hours gaming and you feel\nlike you are accomplished goals and\nleveling up in those games but the\nproblem is you aren't achieving anything\nin the real world in fact it is taking\naway from your life experience all those\nhours spent in gaming could be used to\nmeet new people work on your skills\nlearning a new instrument playing sports\nor working out it is really one of those\nactivities where if you aren't able to\nmake a living from it you are just\nbetter off completely cutting it or at\nthe very least to limit it to just a few\nhours per week excessing gaming can also\nlead to the fifth habit that is making\nyou uglier and these two most of the\ntime go hand to hand you aren't sleeping\nenough the dopamine surges that gaming\nprovides specially coupled with playing\nit at night time will naturally cause\nyou to fall asleep late and most of you\nare in school working jobs so you still\nhave to wake up early I think we all\nknow that lack of sleep reeks Havoc not\nonly in someone's attractiveness but\nalso Health but gaming is not the only\nculprit when it comes to this social\nmedias and apps like Discord are also\nnotorious I myself have been guilty of\nmaking this mistake sometimes I plan on\ngoing to bed at a certain time but then\nI end up talking and chatting with\nfriends on Discord for hours poor sleep\nwill lead to lower testosterone levels\nlower energy levels and just a lack of\nability to focus on what needs to be\ndone thought out the day avoid falling\ninto this habits and within a few months\nyou should start noticing that you are\nmaking progress looking better and being\nhealthier as well don't forget to check\nout that link to get started on the\nskincare and check my channel to learn\nall about looksmaxing"}]}

"you've probably been researching on the\ninternet on how to become more confident\nand typically this is going to be the\noutcome the videos or the Articles you\nwatch will make you feel good in the\nmoment but after a few hours you will be\nback to your regular self confidence can\ncome from past successes positive\nfeedback from others or a simply strong\nbelief in yourself which can come from\nyour abilities qualities or looks\nhowever it must be noted that this can\nonly happen when you actually have those\nabilities we don't live in a dream world\nwhere just relying on your self-belief\nis ever going to cut it one must be\ndelusional to think of it that way\nconfidence is not an innate fixed\ncharacteristic it's an ability that can\nbe acquired and improved over time but\nhere's the problem you can watch as many\nvideos as you want or as many articles\nbut until you start addressing the real\nissues for your lack of confidence and\ntaking action in the real world you will\nnever Gain real confidence to make it\nsimple in order for you to gain real\nconfidence you're going to have to\nincrease your physical attractiveness\nimprove your skills which are probably\ngoing to lead to a higher income improve\nyour social skills SKS and improve your\nmindset and mental health when it comes\nto physical attractiveness this is the\ntopic that I have covered extensively in\nmy channel and for a good reason since\nin my opinion this is one of the most\npowerful and genuine ways to gain real\nConfidence from facial attractiveness to\nsex appeal to building a great physique\nyou should be doing all of this\nsimultaneously if you ask me the ground\nzero starts with building a good\naesthetic physique this is the base for\neverything else and there's actually\nstudies to back this up for instance\nthis study from 2017 found that physical\nstrength determines over 70% of a man's\nbodily\nattractiveness additional analyses\nshowed that tallness and leanness were\nalso favored and along with estimates of\nphysical strength accounted for 80% of\nmen's bodily attractiveness contrary to\npopular theories of men's physical\nattractiveness there was no evidence of\na nonlinear effect the strongest men\nwere the most attractive in all samples\nin in other words having a good muscle\nbase being lean and being physic\nphysically strong will always make you\nmore attractive and thus increase your\nconfidence now for facial attractiveness\nskin homogeneity has a very determinant\nrole in facial attractiveness a smooth\neven toned complexion is associated with\nyouth Health and Beauty results suggest\nthat apparent health of facial skin is\ncorrelated both with ratings of male\nfacial attractiveness and with being a\nvisual cue for judgments of the\nattractiveness of male faces these\nfindings underline the importance of\ncontrolling for the influence of visible\nskin condition in studies of facial\nattractiveness and are consistent with\nthe proposal that attractive physical\ntraits are those that positively\ninfluence others perceptions of an\nindividual's Health skin is something\nthat you can start improving right now\nand because I know you guys want\nconvenience in a simple system to follow\nrather than having to research different\nproducts and going down a rabbit hole\nonly in that to end up even more\nconfused and not do anything that is the\nlast thing you want to do for this\nreason you should get on a good skincare\nroutine and this is why why today I am\nexcited to have te Hanley as the sponsor\nof today's video te Hanley simplifies\nthe process of taking care of your skin\nthey provide you with all the products\nyou need and nothing more that is not\nnecessary seriously I still think some\nof you don't believe me when I tell you\nhow much of a difference implementing a\nquality skincare routine can do to\nimprove your confidence in all aspects\nof your life I recommend you start with\ntheir level one system which comes with\nall the basics a daily face wash an\nexfoliating scrub an AM moisturizer with\nSPF 20 and a PM moisturizer te Hanley\nprovides this instruction card in every\nbox that tells you when to use each\nproduct how much to use and in what\norder it makes it so much simpler for\nguys like me and you and because te\nHanley is sponsoring today's video just\nclick the first link in the description\nand you'll get 30% off your first box\nplus a free gift click that link and get\nstarted today get a perm seriously this\nadvice will seem unorthodox but hear me\nout and just to clarify this applies for\nyou guys that have pin straight hair pin\nstraight hair that falls flat can look\nboring and be very difficult to Style by\ngetting a perm you will change the\nnatural structure of your hair giving it\nwaves or curls and texture a lot of the\nyoung guys you see on Tik Tok have perms\nand you cannot achieve such hairstyles\nif you have pin straight hair no matter\nhow much products and heating tools you\nuse you don't have to get a typical\nnormal perm you can get a Korean perm\nwhich will give you a more soft and\nnatural looking waves so instead of you\ngetting curly hair you will get wavy\nhair this is yet another thing you can\ndo right now that will give you more\nconfidence dress and smell better\nputting effort into dressing and\nsmelling better can have an astonishing\nimpact in the way you perceive yourself\nand the way others perceive you there\nare a lot of styles you can try to\nemulate and obviously the way you dress\nwill depend on your age and especially\nphysical shape the better physical shape\nthe easier it is to look good on almost\nanything and if you're still a young guy\nyou can get away with more boyish Styles\nas opposed to when you're in mid 20s it\nis a good idea to start wearing more\nclassy whether you like old money Mone\naesthetic baggy clothes classy casual or\nbusiness casual it is up to you to\ndecide just make sure you feel good and\ncomfortable while wearing those clothes\nthe fit is also key and perhaps the most\nimportant part you can also go to\nPinterest see what the men your age are\nwearing to find inspiration also a quick\ntip when you go out to shop for clothes\nmake sure you always bring a women\npreferably within your age group to get\nher feedback yeah that means you\nshouldn't be buying clothes and\nfollowing your mother's advice you also\ndon't need to spend all your money on\nclothes places like Zara or HM have\naffordable quality clothes for\nfragrances have two to three fragrances\nyou like for example I like Aqua deio\nfor summer and spring Dolce gabana the\none for a more strong winter Vibe the\ngood old Dior Sage to go out to a party\nand I also like Versace poor H to go to\nthe gym or something more casual make\nmore money having access to resources\nhas the same effect in improving your\nconfidence as improving your physical\nattractiveness remember that idea you\nalways wanted to do but you never have\nthe confidence or The Willpower to start\nstart it now and don't give yourself\nexcuses look at me I started this\nchannel in January 2023 and most people\nwould say it's very late in the game to\nstart and yet I started it and here we\nare whether you choose to start a\nbusiness or becoming incredibly good at\nyour skill set this is a thing that will\nimprove your life on every single way\nand obviously one of the side effects of\nmaking money will be a lot more of\nconfidence mindset and mental health\nmindset ties in a lot with the previous\npoints spoken when you get on this\njourney you're going to have to cut some\npeople off in order to keep your mental\nhealth there's always going to be those\nfriends of yours that will try to drag\nyou down they will ask you why you\nworking so hard they will ask you why\nyou are suddenly dressing better why you\nsuddenly look cleaner why are you in\nbetter shape you should enjoy life more\nif you have friends like this it's time\nto let them go not only will they set\nyou on the bad path they will also\nreduce your confidence in doing the\nthings that you truly want you see real\nconfidence is built when you set goals\nand you accomplish them even if they are\nsmall goals accomplishing them gives you\na feeling of self-fulfillment and great\nconfidence in your abilities which then\nyou're going to use to keep repeating\nthe same cycle over and over again and\nthat is how winners are made you can\nreach out to me by clicking on this link\non the description or comment to get a\ndetailed and customized look SMX plan\nthat's it for today if you guys enjoy my\ncontent make sure you subscribe and if\nyou are new to the channel I suggest you\nwatch these two videos to

understand the pain you're going\nthrough right now summer is approaching\nand you were hoping to have clear and\nglowing skin by then today I'm going to\nteach you how to achieve that however\nit's important to be patient and stay\nstrong because achieving good skin takes\ntime no one can accurately predict how\nlong it will take for you to get clear\nand glowing skin since everyone has\ndifferent skin types genetics diets and\nother variables that's why having the\nright mindset is crucial in this journey\nto achieve clear skin speaking of\nmindset don't get discouraged when you\nsee so many people on social media with\nPerfect Skin nowadays skin filters are\nvery common and you can always expect\npeople you see online to be using some\nsort of skin or beauty filter when they\npost photos to start we need to focus on\nimproving our general health because\nhaving good skin is closely linked to\noverall well-being one often overlooked\naspect is drinking enough water I can\nalmost guarantee that the majority of\nyou don't drink enough water now what is\nconsidered enough water that varies from\nperson to person factors such as climate\nactive levels and other variables come\ninto play A good rule of thumb is to\nobserve the color of your urine if\nyou're drinking enough water the color\nwill be around a pale yellow a darker\nyellow color indicates the need to\nincrease your water intake drinking an\nappropriate amount of water benefits the\nskin by helping your digestive system\nflush out toxins which promotes healthy\nand glowing skin additionally it helps\nmaintain hydration levels in your skin\nnow let's talk about diet it's important\nto focus on consuming low glycemic foods\nand minimize refined sugars many people\nexperience a significant reduction in\nacne lesions just by making these\ndietary changes certain dairy products\nsuch as cow's milk may also increase the\nrisk of developing acne so reducing it\nor completely quitting it can lead to\nimprovements in acne consider adding\nprobiotics to your diet as well poor gut\nhealth has been associated with\nincreased susceptibility to developing\nacne so consuming probiotics can improve\nyour gut health and in turn benefit your\nskin before we can establish a skin care\nroutine we need to determine your skin\ntype there are four main skin types dry\noily combination and normal you may have\nalso heard of terms such as dehydrated\nskin sensitive skin and acne prone skin\nbut these are not actual skin types they\nare skin concerns it's possible to have\ncombinations like dehydrated oily skin\nsensitive oily skin and dry acne prone\nskin to find out your skin type I\nrecommend the following method cleanse\nyour face with a gentle cleanser and\nrefrain from moisturizing or using any\nskin care products for one to two hours\nafterwards Place blotting paper all\naround your face if the paper sticks to\nyour face all around it's safe to say\nyou have oily skin if the paper Falls\nimmediately you have dry skin if the\npaper stays on the forehead nose and\nChin known as the T-Zone but falls on\nthe cheeks you have combination skin you\ncan also observe the amount of oil the\npaper absorbs oily skin will have shine\nin larger pores while dry skin will have\nsmaller pores a flaky and dull\nappearance and feel tight to the touch\nif the paper sticks to your skin but you\ndon't see much oil or just a bit in the\nT-Zone and you don't feel any dryness\nthen you have normal skin If you\nexperience irritation redness or Burning\nSensations your skin might be sensitive\nit's important to note that skin types\nare not set in stone and can change\ndepending on factors such as the season\nclimate age hormones and other\nenvironmental factors here's what you\nshould do every morning wash your face\nwith lukewarm water using a gentle\ncleanser suitable for your skin type\nafterward Pat your face dry but don't\ndry it completely leave it slightly damp\nthen apply your moisturizer followed by\nsunscreen to complete your routine at\nnight repeat the same steps as the\nmorning routine excluding sunscreen\ninstead use a retinoid side note if your\nface is very dry or sensitive you can\nskip the cleanser in the morning and\ninstead just wash your face with water\nand continue with the normal routine\nsteps retinoids are vitamin A\nderivatives and considered the gold\nstandard for anti-aging they increase\nskin cell production help unclog pores\nboost collagen production and improve\nfine lines and wrinkles giving your skin\na more youthful appearance there are\ndifferent types of retinoids available\non the market prescription-based\nretinoic acid particularly tretinoin\nalso known as Retin-A is the most\nwell-known and widely used\nover-the-counter options include\nretinols and retinaldehy these are\nweaker and take longer to see results\nthis is because over-the-counter\nretinoids need to be converted by the\nenzymes in the skin to their active form\nretinoic acid the effectiveness of this\nconversion process depends on the\nformulation of the product and varies\nfrom Brand to Brand unlike prescription\nmedications like tretinoin retinol is a\ncosmetic ingredient and manufacturers\ndon't have to provide the same level of\nevidence for its efficacy however\nthere's a good over-the-counter option\ncalled adipolene it is a third\ngeneration topical retinoid it doesn't\nneed to be converted to retinoic acid\nbefore becoming active adipolene has\nbeen proven to be as effective as\ntretinoin in treating acne and is\ngenerally gentler causing less\nirritation making adipolene more\nsuitable for those with sensitive acne\nprone skin the adapylene molecule is\nalso more stable compared to tretinoin\nmaking it suitable for use in\nconjunction with benzoyl peroxide\nanother active ingredient commonly used\nto treat acne although limited\ninformation is available there are\nindications that adapylene may have\nanti-aging benefits such as preventing\nfine lines and wrinkles so which\nretinoid should you choose if you're\nprimarily interested in dealing with\nacne I recommend adipoline as the only\nstrong retinoid available over the\ncounter if you're an older individual\nlooking to improve your skin complexion\nand address fine lines and wrinkles I\nsuggest booking an appointment with a\ndermatologist and considering tretinoin\ntretinoin is a powerful retinoid so it's\nadvisable to start with the lowest\nconcentration remember this isn't\nmedical advice so always consult with\nyour dermatologist when you start using\na retinoid you'll likely experience some\nside effects I recommend starting with\ntwice a week usage and gradually\nincreasing frequency as your skin\nadjusts eventually you'll be able to use\nthe retinoid every night without major\nproblems this initial is known as\nretinization during which the skin\nadapts to the retinoid treatment you may\nexperience dryness redness burning or\nstinging sensation and peeling these\nsymptoms should diminish after a few\nweeks of use to assist this process try\nsandwiching your retinoid after\ncleansing and gently patting your face\ndry while it's still slightly damp apply\nmoisturizer wait for it to absorb apply\na pea-sized amount of your retinoid and\nfinish with another layer of moisturizer\nyou can also protect the corners of your\nmouth in the area surrounding your nose\nwith petroleum jelly Vaseline before\napplying the retinoid if you need help\ndeveloping a skin care routine or find\nskin care to be too complicated consider\ngetting a face in smv analysis from me\nalong with a tailored skin care routine\nyou'll receive a comprehensive looks Max\nplan I'll provide the links in the\ndescription and pinned comments I will\nalso include product recommendations for\neach skin type in the video description\nlastly if you

to\nyour skin by focusing on the basics\ncleansing moisturizing sunscreen and a\nretinoid you can make significant\nimprovements to your skin if you've made\nit this far in the video please

maxing is the idea of improving\nyour looks in every way possible\nnowadays because of social media and\ndating apps we live in a society where\nlooks are extremely important in dating\nlife and it even transcends to\neverything else like business and career\nopportunities before we start I think\nthat at this point I shouldn't need to\nmention the very\nBasics sleeping at least 8 hours a night\nmaintaining good hygiene eating a\nhealthy balanced diet drinking enough\nwater taking a vitamin D3 supplement if\nyou can can't get 20 to 30 minutes of\nsun exposure a day trying to manage your\nstress and staying off\ndrugs by far the best look SMX there is\nis to just get lean yes you are probably\nnot lean enough yes your 15% body fat is\nnot good enough in today's market you\nthink you are lean because you see a bit\nof your abs but you still don't have a\nfull six-pack 10 to 12% is the ideal\nbody fat range for males if you guys pay\nclose attention all the attractive men\nthat young women send simp and Lust For\nthey all share one thing in common they\nare lean so if you are currently\noverweight you have no business\ncomplaining about the dating Market lose\nthe damn weight and you will not only\nlook better but you will be\nhealthier now we moving on hair and this\ncategory is extremely important but\ndon't just take my word for\nit dating bald or dating with hair I\ncreated two different profiles on an\nonline dating app I swiped 200 times\nwith both profil in multiple days and\nthese were the result my bold self got\n17 chances for a date my hair self got\n42 chances for a date the match rate was\n9% versus 177% respectively you want to\nbe choosing not to be chosen women are\nobsessed with their hair they will\nbecome obsessed with yours\ntoo now that we have seen actual\nevidence of how important hair is and\nlet me just address one thing those\ntypes of experiments are really one of\nthe very few instances where you can see\ngenuinely what women respond positively\nto because in these scenarios the girls\ndon't have to Virtue signal it's\nAnonymous and they will simply swipe\nright or left on you you should never\ntake what a girl says in an interview\nbecause they will virtue signal and not\nbe honest so now we have to address the\nelephant in the room hair loss if you\nare currently experiencing hair loss it\nis extremely essential that you start to\ntake action right now minoxidil\nfinasteride dermarolling and ru58841 are\ncompounds proven to work against hair\nloss finasteride also exists in topical\nform and I would actually recommend this\novertaking it systemically in the future\nI will have a detailed video talking\nabout hair loss and all the compounds I\njust mentioned now for your haircuts and\nhairstyles you shouldn't try to copy\nsomeone else's style randomly instead\nwhat you should be doing is finding a\ncelebrity actor or model that has your\npheno type and hair type and see what\nkind of hairstyles they are using\nobviously your hair texture and\nthickness will vary and you will never\nbe able to copy exactly someone's\nhairstyle but this is how you should\napproach it you should also stay away\nfrom Buzz Cuts or short hairstyles\nunless you have a very masculine face\nbecause it will expose your skull shape\nand it's going to make the framing of\nyour face in general just look bad and\nalso most men are using some sort of\nshort-haired hairstyles so by doing this\nyou are going to just blend in with the\ncrowd quick tip please stop using\nshampoo every single day it makes your\nhair look worse and lifeless because\nyou're stripping all its natural oils\ndon't use shampoo more than twice a week\nand your hair will thank you for it now\nmoving to yet a very important category\nand that is skin anyone who has spent\ntheir teenage years with some sort of\nacne will know the struggle women in\ngeneral feel repulsed by acne because\nskin is a health indicator and acne\nsignals to women that you are in poor\nhealth so I mentioned this earlier on\nbut drinking enough water in my\nexperience does do have a very positive\neffect on skin and a good healthy diet\nalso tends to improve your skin over\ntime for example for me removing Dairy\nhelped a lot in dealing with acne making\nmy skin look better and reducing\ninflammation you should have a skin care\nroutine but it doesn't need to be\nanything complicated all you really need\nis a gentle cleanser a lightweight\nmoisturizer exfoliator and sunscreen I\nwould stay away from male branded\nskincare simply because it is more\nexpensive and it is not going to give\nyou better results these basic skincare\nproducts are not magic they're not\nactive ingredients so you shouldn't be\npaying a premium when you can buy from\nreputable Brands and save some money\nthis is all you should be doing as a\nyoung guy especially if you do not have\nacne or other skin problems because\ngetting good skin is a long process and\nwill take some time potentially months\nuntil you see changes you will need\nsomething in the meantime to improve the\nappearance of your skin and so I\nrecommend Tinted Moisturizer they work\nby matching to your skin tone the\npigments help to lightly blur the\nappearance of blemishes and\nimperfections but if you were a prolific\nlook maxer and you want to do the extra\nmile you can incorporate a retinoid\nvitamin C and red light therapy in your\nroutine the vitamin C you can buy over\nthe counter in the weakest forms of\nretinoids you can as well but I would\ntry to get tretinoin since it is the\nactive ingredient with the most\nscientific studies backing it up troin\nwill help with aging and it's also very\ncompetent at reducing acne another\nretinoid you can use is adapalene\nalthough less potent than Tre o it is\nmore potent than the normal ones you can\nbuy over the counter the reason is that\nthese will greatly improve your collagen\nand collagen is basically what keeps\nyour skin looking young in moderate to\nsevere acne cases you should visit a\ndermatologist and they will prescribe to\nyou some active ingredients that you can\nincorporate into your skincare routine\nand lastly if you had acne previously\nand you want to get rid of scars you can\nget dermabrasion among other laser\ntreatments to remove your acne\nscares having white and straight teeth\nis is a must and is also a status symbol\nit signals to other people that you at\nthe very least have the money to fix\nyour teeth or you've got good genetics\nin that regard so the first step is if\nyou have straight teeth I would go to a\ndentist and get teeth whitening if you\ndon't have straight teeth you must visit\nan orthodontist and if you have bite\nproblems this will complicate things and\nyou will need to be very careful with\nthe orthodontist in some cases you might\nneed to get second and third opinions on\nyour issue for instance the thing I\ndon't see mentioned ever in looksmaxing\nvideos about teeth is that in some cases\nbraces might not be enough and in fact\nyou might require a jaw surgery in\ncombination with orthodontic treatment\nto fix your problem I will give an\nexample if you are an adult and you have\na overbite you should avoid at all costs\na retraction based orthodontic treatment\nbecause what they do is make the upper\nteeth go back to meet the lower teeth\nand thus fixing your overbite but with a\npenalty on your facial Aesthetics\nbecause now your midf face will look\nmore suned in and if worse facial\nAesthetics are not enough to detract you\nfrom doing such a treatment you will\nhave a smaller Airway so you will\nbreathe worse and you have an increased\nrisk of developing sleep apnea I'm only\nscratching the surface here guys I\nencourage you to do research and don't\ngo with whatever the first orthodontist\ntells you you should get multiple\nopinions and always avoid retraction\nbased methods if you hear the words like\nremoving your first premolar teeth and\nelastics do not accept that\ntreatment now we are moving on to\ngrooming and like with hairstyles\ngrooming also depends on phenotype age\nand level of attractiveness never listen\nto extreme opinions like this when\ntalking about facial hair it totally\ndepends on the individual I don't\nrecommend full beards because they tend\nto make you look older stubble has been\nshown to consistently be the most\nattractive facial hairstyle however like\nI said it totally depends on the\nindividual for example a young pretty\nboy will obviously look better with a\nclean shaved face a guy in his mid 20s\nwith Mediterranean phenotype will look\nthe best with some sort of facial hair\nusually stubble beard guys who have\nweaker Jaws might benefit from longer\nfacial hair so it always depends on the\nindividual it depends on age phenotype\nand level of attractiveness attractive\nmen tend to have very good jaw\ndevelopment so in a lot of cases clean\nshaveing to light stubble is the best\nlook for them Austin Dunham is a good\nexample that even with a very good jaw\ndevelopment he still benefited from\nhaving facial hair versus being clean\nshaven it is undeniable that he is seen\nas more attractive now in the eyes of\nwomen as proven by his results on dating\napps and the reactions he gets when\ngoing out of course for you to find out\nwhat suits you the most you must be able\nto grow a full beard and if for whatever\nreason maybe genetics you were unable to\ngrow a full beard you can try minoxidil\non your face I recommend that you apply\nit twice a day and combine it with\ndermar rolling as that has been shown to\nimprove the results if you are one of\nthe people that do not respond to\nMinoxidil you can include tronoid I\ntalked about trono in the skin section\nbut in addition tretinoin has been shown\nto enhance minoxidil response and I can\npersonally vouch for this\nmyself eyebrows are often neglected by\nmen but they can affect your looks\nvastly the outer length of your eyebrows\nshould at least reach the outer part of\nyour eyelids but ideally they can be a\nbit longer for the inner length you want\nyour eyebrows to be almost parallel to\nyour nose drills if you trim too much\nyou will look like this and if you don't\ntrim at all you will look like this\npositively tilted eyebrows are the most\nideal but neutral tilt is not a negative\nwhile negative tilted eyebrows in most\ncases are less attractive thicker\neyebrows are more attractive for men\nthan thin eyebrows as well as darker\neyebrows to grow thicker and darker\neyebrows you can use once again\nminoxidil on your eyebrows castor oil\nlatis and dermar rolling if you don't\nhave naturally dark eyebrows you can\nalso grab an eyebrow pen to make your\neyebrows darker Fuller and thicker once\nyou have thick and dense eyebrows you\ncan start shaping Shing them use a\ntweezer and definitely don't go\noverboard with this otherwise you will\nend up looking like this a quick tip I\nwant to mention is if you have eyesight\nproblems you should consider using\ncontact lenses instead of using glasses\nin my opinion glasses make most guys\nlook\nworse building an aesthetic lean\nphysique is going to make you much more\nattractive and most of you are average\nlooking facially so you can't really\nafford to not have a lean physique in\n2023 a physique combined with all the\nsoft Maxes listed in this video will\nseparate you from the Normie this\nsection requires a video of its own but\nsimply put this are my recommendations\nfor all of you that are starting out if\nyou start as a skinny fat individual you\nmust first lose some body fat until you\nstart to see your abdominal muscles this\nwill give you motivation because as your\nbody fat goes down your facial\nattractiveness will increase if you\nstart as a fat individual the same\napplies and if you start as a skinny\nindividual you must lean bulk 250 to 300\ncalories above maintenance for your diet\nand focusing on Progressive overload on\nthe key compound lifts at the gym such\nas overhead shoulder press chinups and\npull-ups rows bench press and squats\nwill allow you to gain\nmuscle sometimes soft maxing is not\nenough and if surgery or any other\nprocedures are things that are going to\nreally improve your looks I don't see\nwhy you shouldn't do it the only thing I\nwould say is always make sure you're in\nthe right financial situation and You'\nhave carefully thought and planned with\na good professional this particularly\ncase on the screen is someone who would\nnever truly look good if he didn't do\nthis jaw surgery because his jaw bones\nwere very small and recessed and his\nbite was very bad I mentioned this\nearlier in the teeth section but just\nusing braces in this case wouldn't be\nenough because it wasn't just a teeth\nproblem it was a bone structure problem\nas you can see this guy got an insane\nresult he is now attractive and and if\nhe applies all the things I mentioned\nearlier he will become even more\nattractive another surgery where I think\nit has the potential to elevate\nsomeone's Harmony quite a bit is nose\njobs and this is fairly obvious although\nalways make sure that you are dealing\nwith a top professional as these kinds\nof surgeries have the potential to have\nthe opposite effect and you ending up\nwith a less harmonious face hair\ntransplants are also huge at changing\nsomeone's appearance however it is\nimportant to take action early and\ncombine it with the methods I talked\nabout in the hair section because with\nhair loss it can get to a point where\nyou won't have enough hairs in the donor\narea for the hair transplant to be\neffective fillers can also be a decent\noption although they are temporary and\nyou would need to refill them every year\nand that could get costly but as you can\nsee there is some potential in this\nresults I wouldn't recommend you do this\nuntil you try to get at least a 12% body\nfat and see how your jawline looks like\nbut either way you guys have options and\nlastly I want to talk about hormonal\nreplacement therapy whether it is\ntestosterone or human growth hormone if\nyou are clinically deficient in them and\ncan't get your levels up naturally these\nthings are very important and they\nshould be done under a qualified\ndoctor's supervision having high\ntestosterone levels within the normal\nrange is a critical component for looks\nmaxing because it will allow you to\nbuild muscle easier and faster but the\nbiggest game changer comes when you try\nto lean down with high testosterone\nlevels because you're going to retain\nmore muscle and look fuller when you are\ndown to 10 to 12% body fat another\ncomponent of testosterone is that it\nslightly changes the way your face\nstores fat so your face will have a more\nmasculine appearance and that adds to\nyour overall appeal lastly the mental\nbenefits of being high testosterone are\nhuge I am willing to bet that a lot of\ndoomers in the black pill spaces have\npoor hormonal profiles and lower than\naverage testosterone levels because all\nthey do is sit and cry all day long\nabout how over it is and when you are a\nmale with high testosterone you simply\ndon't display this kind of behavior you\nwill know what you have to improve on\ngo to work and make it happen if you are\nnot quite sure where exactly you stand\non the current dating market value and\nyou want detailed personalized looks\nmaxing advice you can order a facial and\nsmv Analysis from me and I will point\nyou in the right direction that's it for\ntoday feel free to drop a

"content": "[Music]\nmale vs female gays and physiques\non one hand you have the more hardcore\nblack pillars that think that you can\nonly go as far as looking like this\nbecause otherwise you will be too big\nand at that point you are male gaze\nmaxing as some of them might say and\nthen although a small minority there is\nalso a group of people that Advocate to\nlooking like this\nbasically the whole bear mode with big\nbeard short or even bald hair this is\nthe true definition of male gaze maxing\nand the only thing you're going to\nachieve with this is getting more\ncompliments and respect from other men\nand looking older in the process vast\nmajority of women do not find that\nattractive at all and in fact some might\neven be grossed out by it how are you\nfeeling\nso I want to show you the perfect\nexample of someone who in terms of\nphysique was on the female gaze and now\nis definitely on the male gay side the\n100 kilograms version of this dude is\njust at the point where it's too big and\nit doesn't appeal to the female gays he\nhas decreased his smv compared to his\nprevious 71 Kilograms physique but hey\nit's for sure gonna get you more\ncompliments from the gym Bros\nI lost 30 pounds and the craziest part\nis the difference between girls and guys\nall the Bros are like damn bro you lost\nweight or losing his gains granted I\nactually have lost some gains so they're\nnot I'm correct but I lose weight and\nthese are what the comments look like\npurely girls whereas when I was 20\npounds bigger comments was purely guys\nthere's a certain point where muscle\ndoesn't equate to uh it just gives you\nmore guys\nnow this next one case involves pretty\nmuch one of the worst looks Maxes of all\ntime this tick tocker was female gazed\nbut as you can see he was quite skinny\nand to be honest this can still work\nwhen you're a teen but he subconsciously\nfelt like he needed to improve and there\nis nothing wrong with that however the\nway he went about it is completely wrong\nand he even gets called out for it in\nthe comments he did two critical\nmistakes the first one was cutting his\nhair to a buzz cut and this revealed his\nreceding hairline contrary to what some\nguys in the looks Max Community say I\nthink this guy already had the receding\nhairline it's just the fact that the\nprevious hairstyle was hiding it very\nwell the second mistake was that this\nguy bulked too much in a single year\nhe's likely using Peds but even on Peds\nyou can't gain 40 kilograms of body\nweight not only it is extremely\nunhealthy for an individual to gain that\namount of body weight in such a short\namount of time but also it will\npermanently Aid you because of all the\nsystemic stress and obviously he's\nextremely bloated and lost all his\nfacial Aesthetics because his body fat\nis way outside of an ideal range of 10\nto 12 percent remember how I said he\ngets called out in the comments see it\nfor yourself this is what happens when\nyou go to the male gay Spectrum route\nyou get attention from other men and\ngirls find you either unattractive or\nstraight up up disgusting this my\nfriends is how you become a Polish truck\ndriver not how you look smacks now in\nterms of the female gay Spectrum there\nis quite a range that you can be and be\nfully female gays because it will depend\non your phenotype your archaea type and\neven just how attractive your face\nreally is for example if you are as\nattractive as this guys your only\nconcern is to be lean and to not look\nlike a twink meaning that you can get\naway with physiques like this but vast\nmajority of you are average looking so\nin order for you to separate yourself\nfrom the other average guys around you\nneed to develop your physique\nTyson Bedford paid the girls a visit to\nteach them about being a spokes model I\nwould freely seriously really hurry up\nthe girls had a new Focus for their male\nfantasies\n[Applause]\nwhat's up\nand say what's the point of me going to\nthe gym because I will never have the\nlevel of attractiveness that they have\nand this is where I'm gonna have to\nbring out the graphics because I really\nthink this is the only way that some of\nyou are going to understand why staying\nat home crying on forums and spreading\nyour black pill poison is a waste of\ntime so here it goes say the guys you\nwere all crying about are all in here\nvery well in the a plus category now\nlet's all assume most of you are around\na 4.5 to 6.5 in attractiveness\nstatistically this is not far-fetched\nnow if you guys are doing all the basic\nsoft Maxes but more importantly you get\nto a point where you develop a very good\naesthetic lean physique you guys are\ngoing to improve massively your score at\nthe lowest case possible some of you are\ngoing to be sevens and some of you who\nwere sixes and might have had some\npretty boy or more of a classic Chad\npotential now you guys are eight plus\nsure these guys over here are still more\nattractive than you but it doesn't\nmatter because now you've got to the\npoint where you can have abundance when\nyou now create a Tinder profile you are\ngoing to get results and more\nimportantly abundance and ability to\nchoose and the reason why all this other\nguys don't even matter is because they\nare not in your area you are not\ncompeting against them you are competing\nagainst locals that's it for today feel\nfree to comment down below what you\nwould like to see me talking about in\nthe next videos and make sure you\nsubscribe to this channel"}]}
